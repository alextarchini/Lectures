            WHO DISCOVERED AMERICA? THE OLD WORLD VERSUS THE NEW WORLD. CHRISTOPHER
            COLUMBUS AND OTHER EXPLORERS. THE NATIVE AMERICANS 1. The New World The
            term "New World" (Mundus Novus) was first coined by
            the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci, in a letter written to his
            friend and former patron Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici in the
            Spring of 1503, and published (in Latin) in 1503-04 under the title Mundus
            Novus. Vespucci's letter contains arguably the first explicit articulation
            in print of the hypothesis that the lands discovered by European
            navigators to the west were not the edges of Asia, as asserted
            by Christopher Columbus, but rather an entirely different continent, a
            "New World”. After returning from Brazil, in the Spring of 1503, Amerigo
            Vespucci composed the Mundus Novus letter in Lisbon to Lorenzo in
            Florence. The Old World consists
            of Africa, Europe, and Asia, regarded collectively as the part of
            the world known to Europeans before contact with the Americas. It is used
            in the context of, and contrast with, the New World (Americas). The idea
            of a glorious earthly paradise far from the known world had existed in the
            European imagination long before the discovery of America. That idea of a
            distant paradise on earth shaped the way Europeans came to think of
            America after Columbus and his successors reported their discoveries. 2.
            Who discovered the New World? How did it come to be known? Leif Eriksson
            The discovery of America has been a disputed question. It is frequently
            associated with the name of the Norse explorer Leif Eriksson (born in the
            10th century). Eriksson is considered by many to be the first European to
            reach North America, centuries before Christopher Columbus. However, the
            details of his voyage are a matter of historical debate, with one version
            claiming his landing accidental and another that he had sailed there
            intentionally after learning of the region from earlier explorers.
            Christopher Columbus Christopher Columbus (or Colombo in Italian) was a
            famous Italian explorer and navigator born in 1451 in the Republic of
            Genoa, Italy in the family of Dominico Columbo. He is best known for the
            claim that he discovered the "New World" of the Americas on an expedition
            sponsored by King Ferdinand of Spain in 1492. In 1492 Columbus left Spain
            in the Santa Maria, with the Pinta and the Niña along side. It is believed
            that he was the one to open up the Americas to European colonization.
            Columbus’s early voyages were in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas. His
            first voyage into the Atlantic Ocean in 1476 nearly cost him his life as
            the commercial fleet he was sailing with was attacked by French privateers
            off the coast of Portugal. His ship was burned and Columbus had to swim to
            the Portuguese shore and make his way to Lisbon. Columbus participated in
            several other expeditions to Africa gaining knowledge of the Atlantic
            currents flowing east and west from the Canary Islands. Muslim domination
            of the trade routes through the Middle East made travel to India and China
            difficult. Believing a route sailing west across the Atlantic would be
            quicker and safer, Columbus devised a plan to sail west to reach the East.
            First Voyage to the New World Rejected by the Portuguese king for a
            three-ship voyage of discovery, Columbus took his plan first to Genoa and
            then to Venice but was rejected there, too. He then went to the Spanish
            monarchy of Isabella of Castille and Ferdinand of Aragon, in 1486. He
            would have to wait until 1492 as their focus was on a war with the
            Muslims. Shortly after the Spanish army captured the last Muslim
            stronghold in Granada in January of 1492, the monarchs agreed to finance
            his expedition. In August of 1492, Columbus left Spain in the Santa Maria,
            with the Pinta and the Niña along side. After 36 days of sailing, Columbus
            and several crewmen set foot on an island in the present day Bahamas,
            claiming it for Spain. Columbus supposed at last he had reached the
            opulent land of the Indies, and so called the natives Indians. But it was
            an island, not a continent or an Asiatic empire, he had found. The natives
            dwelling on the island were found to be a well proportioned people with
            fine bodies, simple in their habits and customs, friendly, though shy in
            manner, and they were perfectly naked. They thought the huge ships to be
            monsters risen from the sea or gods come down from heaven. Presents were
            exchanged with them, including gold bracelets worn by the natives. Inquiry
            was made as to where the gold came from. For answer the natives pointed by
            gestures to the southwest. Columbus tried to induce some of the natives to
            go with him and show where the land of gold was to be found. But this they
            refused to do. Columbus and his men continued their journey, visiting the
            islands of Cuba and Hispaniola (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and
            meeting with the leaders of the native population. During this time, the
            Santa Maria was wrecked on a reef off the coast of Hispaniola. With the
            help of some islanders, Columbus' men salvaged what they could and built
            the settlement Villa de la Navidad ("Christmas Town") with lumber from the
            ship. Thirty-nine men stayed behind to occupy the settlement. Convinced
            his exploration had reached Asia, he set sail for home with the two
            remaining ships. Subsequent Voyages Returning to Spain in 1493, Columbus
            gave a glowing, somewhat exaggerated report and was warmly received by the
            royal court. That same year he took to the seas on his second expedition
            and explored more islands in the Caribbean Ocean. Upon arrival at
            Hispaniola, Columbus and his crew discovered the Navidad settlement had
            been destroyed with all the sailors massacred. Spurning the wishes of the
            queen, who found slavery offensive, Columbus established a forced labor
            policy over the native population to rebuild the settlement and explore
            for gold, believing it would prove to be profitable. His efforts produced
            small amounts of gold and great hatred among the native population. Before
            returning to Spain, Columbus left his brothers Bartholomew and Diego to
            govern the settlement on Hispaniola and sailed briefly around the larger
            Caribbean islands further convincing himself he had discovered the outer
            islands of China. It wasn't until his third voyage that Columbus actually
            reached the mainland exploring the Orinoco River in present-day Venezuela.
            Unfortunately, conditions at the Hispaniola settlement had deteriorated to
            the point of near-mutiny with settlers claiming they had been misled by
            Columbus' claims of riches and complaining about the poor management of
            his brothers. The Spanish Crown sent a royal official who arrested
            Columbus and stripped him of his authority. He returned to Spain in chains
            to face the royal court. The charges were later dropped but Columbus lost
            his titles as governor of the Indies and for a time, much of the riches
            made during his voyages. Convincing King Ferdinand that one more voyage
            would bring the abundant riches promised, Columbus went on what would be
            his last voyage in 1502, traveling along the eastern coast of Central
            America in an unsuccessful search for a route to the Indian Ocean. A storm
            wrecked one of his ships stranding the captain and his sailors on the
            island of Cuba. During this time, local islanders, tired of the Spaniards'
            poor treatment and obsession with gold, refused to give them food. In a
            spark of inspiration, Columbus consulted an almanac and devised a plan to
            "punish" the islanders by taking away the moon. On February 29, 1504, a
            lunar eclipse alarmed the natives enough to re-establish trade with the
            Spaniards. A rescue party finally arrived, sent by the royal governor of
            Hispaniola in July and Columbus and his men were taken back to Spain in
            November of 1504. Modern critics of Columbus assert that his treatment of
            the Indians showed a disregard for their natural rights. OTHER EXPLORERS
            The explorers and conquerors of the New World were undoubtedly courageous
            discoverers who ventured to face the unknown. Sometimes they were
            motivated by spreading Christianity and sometimes by greed and hopes for
            power and eternal youth. These were hopes which more often than not met
            with disappointment and disaster. Discovery narratives traditionally
            report on the technical backwardness of the people of the discovered
            lands. The conquerors believed in the physical, mental and cultural
            inferiority of the conquered and thought that it was their obligation, as
            superior, to make better use of the land and its resources. The
            exploration of the New World yields insight into both the best and worst
            of mankind. Europeans – especially the Spanish, Portuguese and French –
            were excited about the discovery of the new land. It afforded prospects of
            wealth and new resources. The acquisition of vast territories of land
            signified greater prestige and power. The gold and riches of the Aztec,
            Maya and Inca civilizations were surrendered up to Spanish and Portuguese
            ruthless adventurers and by 1600 the southern part of the newly discovered
            Western Hemisphere was firmly under their control. America was a land of
            equal opportunity, unfettered by the social, economic and class traditions
            of Europe, and individual advancement was a more realistic possibility.
            John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto - Italian) - credited with discovering the
            North American continent. He made a British claim to land in Canada
            mistaking it for Asia in 1497. He is considered to be the reason why North
            Americans speak English. He believed that Native Americans could be
            transformed into Englishmen. Ponce de Leon, remembered as the discoverer
            of Florida. Hernando de Soto discovered the Mississippi river while
            searching for gold. Henry Hudson discovered Hudson Bay.  Robert de La
            Salle discovered Texas. Sir Walter Raleigh, famous for his efforts in

            2. THE NATIVE AMERICANS
            Most of the Native American tribes living on the territory of present-day
            USA have never had an alphabet of their own. In 1821 a half-Cherokee
            Indian named Sequoya invented a syllabary for the purposes of his own
            tribe. The only complete writing system in the ancient New World was the
            Maya script. By the time the white settlers set foot on the North American
            continent, the native tribes had developed a rich oral tradition of lore –
            myths, legends, tales, songs, prayers, rituals, speeches and spells. Each
            had a distinctive way of expressing itself in poetry and prose. What they
            had in common was their reverence for nature, in which they lived in
            harmony and balance, and a worldview, in which the oneness of the
            objective material world with the subjective spiritual world was achieved
            through the immanent presence of the Great spirit. There is hardly a tribe
            that has not got a Creation myth of its own, which shows humankind’s
            undying longing and curiosity to know its origins, the meaning of its
            existence and destiny. A common feature of the Creation myth of the North
            American tribes is the belief that the universe and the world of mankind
            did not emerge from nothingness but through the wish and benevolence of a
            Power which is itself all-pervasive and limitless in Time and Space. The
            world of the Indians is suffused with poetry. Their songs are an
            expression of their innermost being and of their intimate relationship to
            the forces of nature and the universe. There are songs of healing and of
            growth, songs of vision and of dream, death songs and war songs,
            initiation and individual songs. Their poetry serves practical ends. It
            helps the singer to renew his/her own spiritual power, to enhance the
            power of all those natural and supernatural phenomena and forces which
            induce growth and life, and continually to reestablish his/her harmonious
            relationship with them, with his/her fellowmen, and with his/her own inner
            self.

            3. CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH (1580 – 1631) It was not
            until 1607 that the British – led by Captain John Smith – set in motion
            the irreversible process of colonization by establishing the first
            permanent settlement of about one hundred people in Jamestown, Virginia.
            This was followed by that of the Pilgrims in Plymouth (1620), later part
            of the Massachusetts Bay colony (founded 1628 – 30) in what became known
            as New England. Smith produced some of the most detailed reports about
            early Virginia. Recent archaeology has confirmed some of his most famous
            details. He died in England in 1631 at age 51 and is known as the first
            English writer in America. He produced some of the most detailed reports
            about early Virginia: A True Relation of Such Occurrences and Accidents of
            Note as Happened in Virginia (1608) – considered to be THE FIRST ENGLISH
            WORK WRITTEN IN AMERICA: Describes the interactions of the colonists with
            different Native American tribes beginning with the battle upon arrival in
            Jamestown; Details Smith’s exploration of the land and involvement with
            different tribes and tribal leaders, which resulted in trading practices
            that sustained the colony; Notes that Powhatan and his people sent deer,
            bread, corn, turkeys, and other supplies during Smith’s stay in the
            colony; Describes how he was captured, injured, and rescued from certain
            Native American tribes; Internal fighting, sickness, and changes in
            leadership plagued the colony, but Smith ended the relation with optimism
            concerning its survival. This work was first published under the
            title True Relation on 13 August 1608.  Map of Virginia (1612)  Generall
            Historie of Virginia, (New-England, and the Summer Isles)  – first
            published in 1624, it is about: - The rough beginning of the Jamestown
            Colony; - The severe conditions of sea travellers; - The challenges of
            living with Native Americans; - Smith’s romance with Pocahontas. A

        <p> 4. COLONIAL LITERATURE The
            majority of settlements, which made up Britain’s Thirteen Colonies (later
            to become the United States of America) were well established by the
            middle of the eighteenth century, and, although each of these colonies had
            a Governor, they were ultimately answerable to the British crown. Mounting
            prosperity and an expanding – and increasingly self-confident – population
            led to Virginia and Maryland making an appeal to the London Company (an
            organization of English merchants) for larger measures of self-government.
            In an effort to attract more newcomers to the colonies, the London Company
            agreed and in 1619 Virginia established the House of Burgesses, the first
            representative legislature in America. THE NORTHERN COLONIES The New
            England colonies in the north were populated mainly by newly arrived
            Puritans, English Protestants who had initially emigrated from England to
            Holland because of disagreements with the Orthodox Church of England. They
            succeeded in establishing a thriving and diversified economy in the north
            and made a substantial contribution to the development of political
            practices and social beliefs. Indeed, their belief in government by
            contract from the governed was to prove decisive in influencing New
            England principles concerning the value of individual freedom and
            democracy. They also believed strongly in the importance of hard work
            (which conveyed dignity on man and ensured him of a place in God’s favour)
            and education (Harvard and Yale colleges were established in 1636 and 1701
            respectively). They were particularly strict on matters concerning
            morality and religion. Indeed, the society they built up in the northern
            colonies was highly theocratic: civil government officials were chosen
            from among those members of the church who most ardently adhered to the
            principles of the Old Testament, and who were regular churchgoers.
            Religious intolerance and persecution were not unknown in Massachusetts,
            as the hanging of nineteen people suspected of witchcraft in 1692 in Salem
            demonstrated. New and less severe ideas took root slowly, and by the time
            Massachusetts became a royal colony in 1691, Puritan rigor was already in
            decline. THE MIDDLE COLONIES Such was the strength of the English presence
            in the colonies that other nations were frustrated in their efforts to
            establish permanent settlements of their own. In 1664 England took over
            the middle colonies of Dutch-controlled New Netherland (later New York)
            and Swede-dominated New Sweden. Another settlement in what is now
            Pennsylvania was chartered to William Penn in 1681. Penn was a member of a
            much persecuted religious group called the Quakers, and other settlers
            seeking freedom from persecution to come to his colony. Pennsylvania
            flourished and its capital city, Philadelphia, rapidly became America’s
            largest city. THE SOUTHERN COLONIES Further south, Carolina was chartered
            out to eight proprietors in 1663: British settlers and French Protestants,
            called Huguenots, combined with other Americans to populate the colony,
            which in 1712 was divided into two – North and South. The well established
            rice and indigo plantations in South Carolina required a substantial work
            force, and many African-Americans were imported to work as slaves by the
            growing number of wealthy landowners. The southernmost part of Carolina
            became known as Georgia in 1733. Plantations and African slaves made up an
            essential part of what was to become a flourishing economy. In contrast to
            life in the north, the country – as opposed to the town – was the main
            unit of government, largely because life was more rural. Large and
            self-sufficient estates, plantations and mansions formed the social
            backbone of southern life. The southern middle classes also gained a
            reputation for being more fun-loving and tolerant in religious matters
            than their northern counterparts. THE POPULATION OF AMERICA By the 1750s
            the population in the colonies had risen from the lowly figure of one
            hundred in 1607 to 360, 000: roughly 20 percent of the population
            consisted of blacks imported from Africa to work as slaves. By the 1750s
            colonial America had become a ‘melting pot’ in terms of both religion and
            race. In addition to Puritans, Quakers and Huguenots, there were Roman
            Catholics, Jews and members of other German Protestant sects who sought
            freedom from religious persecution in the new land. Africans, who had been
            captured during the course of tribal warfare and imported by unscrupulous
            trading merchants, initially possessed the same rights as the newly
            arrived white prisoners from overcrowded English jails. In the beginning
            both were passed into servitude – or ‘indentured’ – for a limited number
            of years, but by the 1660s owners of the Africans (especially in the
            southern colonies) extended these periods of ‘service’ indefinitely. Hence
            the beginning of true slavery in America. By the early 1700s there were
            signs of a growing sense of national identity among the colonists, and
            although they were still ultimately under British rule, crown regulations
            and law were frequently ignored. An increasingly clear conflict of
            interests was to come to a head during the mid 1700s when relations
            between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain began to break down
            definitively. Indeed, Americans had to wait until the mid-nineteenth
            century for a rich and imaginative national literature to rival that of
            the English. Although there were significant exceptions, most Americans
            were concerned with the day to day business of living and the struggle to
            achieve some form of national identity. Early American literature varies
            greatly in quality. Most New England colonists were, like their southern
            counterparts, chiefly engaged in making a home of the wilderness they had
            discovered on America’s shores. The literature of this period is of more
            historical than literary interest to the modern reader. It is largely made
            up of historical and religious journals, letters, speeches, sermons and
            public documents. Prose in the colonial period was dominated by the work
            of New Englanders whose religious writings formed the great bulk of early
            American literature. The quest for spiritual identity in the New World
            persuaded them to write serious and responsible works which often
            contained some kind of moral purpose. Indeed, most of the prose written
            during this period was devoid of entertainment value. Its declared
            function was to instruct, and readers – or listeners – were more often
            than not to be found in the pulpit. Sermons and religious pamphlets dealt
            with the themes of religious tolerance (or intolerance), and other
            ecclesiastical controversies. A strong Puritanical or Calvinistic strain
            ran through much of these works. The literature of the Colonial period can
            be roughly divided into prose connected with history and geography,
            religious writing and colonial poetry. PROSE CONNECTED WITH HISTORY AND
            GEOGRAPHY The other main concern of prose writers was to describe the
            history and geography of the newly settled territories. Accounts of the
            first pioneers and their various activities took the form of newsletters,
            journals, practical handbooks and ordinary letters, and they provide us
            with an interesting picture of early colonial life. The first English
            writer in America was Captain John Smith (1580 – 1631) whose A True
            Relation of Such Occurrences and Accidents of Noate as Hath Hapned in
            Virginia Since the First Planting of that Collony (1608) is a
            straightforward and precise historical account of the Jamestown
            settlement. He also wrote an interesting account of early settlement life
            in Virginia in The General History of Virginia (1624). Other writers
            producing early historical accounts include John Winthrop (1588 – 1649),
            William Bradford (1589 – 1657), William Penn (1644 – 1718) and William
            Byrd (1674 – 1744). Winthrop’s Journal described life in the Massachusetts
            Bay colony from 1630 to 1649, and his advocating of theocratic state was
            echoed by Bradford in his The History of Plymouth Plantation (1646), an
            account of the Pilgrim Fathers and their foundation of the Plymouth
            colony. Penn’s Some Account of the Province of Pennsylvania (1681) was in
            part an attempt to publicize the opportunities offered by life in
            Pennsylvania. Byrd was a Virginia planter and agent for the colony: his
            History of the Dividing Line: Run in the Year 1728 was a witty and
            satirical account of the boundary survey between Virginia and North
            Carolina. RELIGIOUS WRITERS Among the most important religious writers of
            this period were Cotton Mather (1663 – 1728), Jonathan Edwards (1703 –
            1758) and John Woolman (1720 – 1772). The Puritan Mather was the most
            versatile and prolific writer of the age; among the 450 he wrote are a
            number of writings dealing with theological issues. Wonders of the
            Invisible World (1693) defends Mather's role in the witch hunt conducted
            in Salem, Massachusetts, and espousing the belief that witchcraft was an
            evil magical power. Mather saw witches as tools of the devil in Satan's
            battle to "overturn this poor plantation, the Puritan colony", and
            prosecution of witches as a way to secure God's blessings for the colony.
            Mather’s most important work was Magnalia Christi Americana (1702), a
            two-volume ecclesiastical history of New England. His Christian
            Philosopher (1721) recognizes God in the wonders of the earth and the
            universe beyond; it is both philosophical and scientific and, ironically,
            anticipates 18th-century Deism, despite his clinging to the old order.
            Jonathan Edwards was a Calvinist preacher in Massachusetts. As a leader of
            the religious revival movement known as the Great Awakening, he struck the
            fear of God into the hearts of his congregation with fiery sermons. His
            most famous work was Freedom of Will (1754), an influential philosophical
            treatise written in defence of Calvinistic doctrine. The Journal (1774) of
            John Woolman (1720 – 1772), a Quaker leader and early abolitionist, is a
            classic record of the spiritual inner life. COLONIAL POETRY Colonial
            poetry was mainly of a religious nature and was mostly written for friends
            and relatives. The first book to be published in the colonies was the Bay
            Psalm Book (1640), a collection of psalms in verse from intended for group
            singing in the churches. The New England Primer, America’s first text
            book, was used in schools to help people to read. Most Puritans were
            thoroughly familiar with these two volumes. Despite Puritan doubts and
            suspicions about the value of poetry (it was too sensuous and lacked a
            true instructional element), heavily Puritanical elegies and epitaphs were
            composed to honour the dead. The Puritan poet thinks of himself as fallen
            from Adam, as an individual, that distinctness that individuality, is all
            contaminated with the story of self-assertion and corruption he inherited
            from Adam. And so a poet who thinks himself in this way, thinks of himself
            as sinful. While often influenced by English poets of the sixteenth and
            seventeenth centuries, Anne Bradstreet (1612 – 1672), Michael Wigglesworth
            (1631–1705) and Edward Taylor (1642 – 1729) provided American literature
            with its first poetic voices. Anne Bradstreet included simple lyrics and
            poems on nature in her The Tenth Muse, a collection of mainly religious
            poems published in England in 1650. Wigglesworth’s heavily Calvinistic
            ballad style in The Day of Doom (1662) was the most popular literary work
            of colonial times and took its place on most Puritan bookshelves beside
            the Bible and Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress. The most important poet of the
            period was, however, Edward Taylor whose poems were only discovered in
            1937. A fierce Puritan, Taylor spent most of his life as a minister in a
            Massachusetts town. His poems show the influence of the English
            Metaphysicals (especially Herbert and Donne) and many of his finest
            ‘meditations’ were composed to be performed in church as a prelude to his
            sermons.</p>

        <p> 5. THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR (THE US WAR OF INDEPENDENCE) 
         For more than a decade before the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, tensions had been building between colonists and the British authorities. Attempts by the British government to raise revenue by taxing the colonies (notably the Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend Tariffs of 1767 and the Tea Act of 1773) met with heated protest among many colonists, who resented their lack of representation in Parliament and demanded the same rights as other British subjects. Colonial resistance led to violence in 1770, when British soldiers opened fire on a mob of colonists, killing five men in what was known as the Boston Massacre. After December 1773, when a band of Bostonians dressed as Mohawk Indians boarded British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor, an outraged Parliament passed a series of measures (known as the Intolerable, or Coercive Acts) designed to reassert imperial authority in Massachusetts.
          By June 1776 the Revolutionary War was in full swing. 
On July 4th 1776, the Continental Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence, drafted by a five-man committee including Franklin and John Adams but written mainly by Jefferson. 

The American victory Saratoga (1777) would prove to be a turning point of the American Revolution, as it prompted France (which had been secretly aiding the rebels since 1776) to enter the war openly on the American side, though it would not formally declare war on Great Britain until June 1778. The American Revolution, which had begun as a civil conflict between Britain and its colonies, had become a world war.

Triumph at Yorktown (1781), but the British forces remained stationed around Charleston, and the powerful main army still resided in New York.

The British removal of their troops from Charleston and Savannah in late 1782 finally pointed to the end of the conflict. 

British and American negotiators in Paris signed preliminary peace terms in Paris and on September 3, 1783, Great Britain formally recognized the independence of the United States in the Treaty of Paris.

 At the same time, Britain signed separate peace treaties with France and Spain (which had entered the conflict in 1779), bringing the American Revolution to a close after eight long years.

Though the movement for American independence effectively triumphed at Yorktown, contemporary observers did not see that as the decisive victory yet. British forces remained stationed around Charleston, and the powerful main army still resided in New York. Though neither side would take decisive action over the better part of the next two years, the British removal of their troops from Charleston and Savannah in late 1782 finally pointed to the end of the conflict. British and American negotiators in Paris signed preliminary peace terms in Paris late that November, and on September 3, 1783, Great Britain formally recognized the independence of the United States in the Treaty of Paris. At the same time, Britain signed separate peace treaties with France and Spain (which had entered the conflict in 1779), bringing the American Revolution to a close after eight long years.
The Founding Fathers of the United States are the individuals of the Thirteen British Colonies in North America who led the American Revolution against the authority of the British Crown and established the United States of America. The term is also used more narrowly, referring specifically to those who either signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 or who were delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention and took part in drafting the proposed Constitution of the United States. A further subset includes those who signed the Continental Association or the Articles of Confederation.[2] During much of the 19th century, they were referred to as either the "Founders" or the "Fathers".
Some historians apply the term "Founding Fathers" to a larger group of people, including not only the Signers and the Framers but also all those who, whether as politicians, jurists, statesmen, soldiers, diplomats, or ordinary citizens, took part in winning American independence and creating the United States of America.[3] Historian Richard B. Morris in 1973 identified the following seven figures as the key Founding Fathers: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington.[4] Adams, Jefferson, and Franklin worked on the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. Hamilton, Madison, and Jay were authors of the The Federalist Papers, advocating ratification of the Constitution. Washington commanded the revolutionary army. All served in important positions in the early government of the United States.

            AMERICAN LITERATURE IN THE MID- TO LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY As was with
            Britain loomed ever closer, many American prose writers began abandoning
            early Puritanical concerns with religion and took to politics. In an age
            of increasing scientific rationalism, new ideas about equality and liberty
            circulated in Europe. A new and more educated American middle class,
            conscious of its national identity and less enslaved to the rigours of
            Puritanism, emerged during the mid 1700s. This was the age of the orator
            and pamphlet writer whose ‘literary’ efforts were to prove decisive in
            galvanizing public opinion behind the inevitable drive towards
            independence. Indeed, following Stamp Act (1765) dozens of revolutionary
            pamphlets were published. Undoubtedly the two most prominent ‘literary’
            figures of the times were Benjamin Franklin (1706 – 1790) and Thomas Paine
            (1737 – 1809). Statesman, inventor, publisher and printer, Franklin
            rapidly became a spokesman for American interests and declared his open
            hostility towards Britain in a number of clear and concisely written
            pamphlets and political satires. Full of the practically-minded common
            sense attitudes of the American middle classes, Poor Richard’s Almanack
            was written and edited annually by Franklin between 1733 and 1758. Its
            pithy proverbs and prudent observations appealed greatly to the public of
            the time. Franklin will, however, be chiefly remembered for his unfinished
            Autobiography (1771), a highly influential rags to riches account of the
            ‘self made man’. The ‘Declaration of Independence’ (1776), perhaps the
            greatest expression of political liberty in prose, was drafted with the
            help of Franklin, although Thomas Jefferson must take most of the credit
            for its composition. Thomas Paine’s clear and forceful prose works, Common
            Sense (1776) and The Crisis (1776 – 1783), were highly influential in
            encouraging and sustaining American morale during the War of Independence.
            His The Rights of Man (1791) defended the cause of the revolutionaries in
            France, although the principles it extols are of universal concern. An
            interest in the identity and character of America and its people grew as
            the country began to establish itself. The epistolary essays of an
            Americanized Frenchman, Michel Guillaume Jean de Crèvecœur (1735 – 1813),
            did much to satisfy the public curiosity in this respect: his Letters from
            an American Farmer (1782) and his most famous essay, What is an American?
            were to prove influential on later American writers. Poetry offers little
            of interest during this turbulent period, much American verse harking back
            to the models of eighteenth-century neo-classical poetry in Britain. Most
            verse of the time was written in New England. Philip Freneau (1752 – 1832)
            was a New Yorker given to writing patriotic poems and political satires,
            although he is chiefly remembered for his simple nature lyrics, which were
            often thought to herald the arrival of early romantic poetry. A group of
            poets called the ‘Connecticut Wits’ (John Trumbull, Timothy Dwight, David
            Humphreys and Joel Barlow) exhibited a desire for a new ‘national’
            literature liberated from the trappings of European verse models, although
            much of their verse continued the tradition of English satire. From their
            time on, however, Americans were to show greater interest in the formation
            of specifically ‘American’ as opposed to pseudo-English literature. THE
            NEW CONSTITUTION (1783 – 1820) The thirteen colonies of pre-revolutionary
            America were called ‘states’ after the Treaty of Paris in 1783: together
            they formed the ‘United States of America’. Each of the states was
            originally responsible for its own laws and constitution, although under
            the Articles of Confederation, drawn up in 1781, a federal government had
            been set up in an effort to unify the states with regard to foreign
            policy. This was shown to be insufficient, however, since the federal
            government was powerless to impose and collect taxes, raise money for
            national defense or regulate the new nation’s trade. Delegates from twelve
            of the states got together in Philadelphia in 1787 to discuss the problems
            and, under the presidency of George Washington, agreed to abandon the
            Articles of Confederation in favor of a new constitution. This new
            constitution provided for both federal and state powers, and was divided
            up into three branches: the executive, responsible for the implementation
            of laws; the legislature, divided up into the House of Representatives
            (where the number of seats for each state depended on population size) and
            the Senate (regardless of size, all states were to be represented
            equally), responsible for the making of laws; and finally the Judiciary,
            or federal court system. A balanced and flexible constitution, it
            succeeded in welding the states together into one solid political unit.
            Washington became the first President of the United States in 1789. Two
            years later the Bill of Rights, a series of ten amendments to the
            Constitution, provided further guarantees with regard to individual
            rights, including the right to trial by jury and freedom of speech,
            religion and the press. Thomas Jefferson The new nation faced considerable
            financial difficulties following the exhaustive war with Britain, but the
            skill of its leaders and the response of American people ensured that
            these difficulties were eventually overcome. Guided by Alexander Hamilton,
            federal law was imposed in order to collect taxes, which helped ease the
            burden of national debt. Despite opposition on the part of the gifted
            southern politician, Thomas Jefferson, a national bank was chartered for
            twenty years in 1791. The 1790s saw the development of two political
            parties: Hamilton and his followers – mainly from the north – formed the
            Federalist Party which favored strong federal government and support for
            Britain in international disputes. In the south, Jefferson and his
            followers established the Democratic Republican Party: they advocated a
            less centralized form of government and were more inclined to support
            France in their foreign policy. Jefferson became President of the United
            States in 1800 and was re-elected in 1804. His vision of democracy, later
            known as ‘Jeffersonian democracy’, consisted of a firm belief in America
            as a nation of small farmers whose lives should be as little encumbered by
            central government as possible. In 1803 Jefferson carried out the
            Louisiana Purchase whereby the United States paid $ 15 million to France
            for the area of land between the Mississippi River and the Rocky
            Mountains. This purchase effectively doubled the area of US controlled
            territory: thirteen new states were later created from this vast area of
            rich agricultural land. THOMAS PAINE (1737–1809) "Common Sense“ (1776) - a
            50-page pamphlet considered to be his most famous work. After the battles
            of Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775), which were the first military
            engagements of the American Revolutionary War, Paine argued that America
            should not simply revolt against taxation, but demand independence from
            Great Britain entirely. He expanded this idea in the pamphlet. ‘CRISIS’
            PAPERS During the war, Paine served as volunteer personal assistant to
            General Nathanael Greene, traveling with the Continental Army. While not a
            natural soldier, Paine contributed to the patriot cause by inspiring the
            troops with his 16 "Crisis" papers, which appeared between 1776 and 1783.
            "The American Crisis. Number I" was published on December 19, 1776, and
            began: "These are the times that try men's souls." Washington's troops
            were being decimated, and he ordered that the pamphlet be read to all of
            his troops at Valley Forge, in hopes of inflaming them to victory. Plain
            language used by common people. THE AMERICAN CRISIS. NUMBER I. BY THE
            AUTHOR OF COMMON SENSE. THESE are the times that try men's souls: The
            summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from
            the service of his country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love
            and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered;
            yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the
            more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too
            lightly:— It is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven
            knows how to set a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange
            indeed, if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated.
            Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared, that she has a
            right (not only to TAX) but to BIND us in ALL CASES WHATSOEVER, and if
            being bound in that manner is not slavery, then there is not such a thing
            as slavery upon earth. Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a
            power can belong only to GOD. Paine was “a great simplifier who did not
            bother with qualifications and alternatives.” He believed that man is
            naturally the friend of man and that human nature is benign. Paine argues
            that man is a rational animal who will naturally pursue his own
            self-interest. He claimed: “Society is produced by our wants and
            government by our wickedness,” and “Government, even in its best state, is
            but a necessary evil.” Paine finds the “origin and rise of government” in
            “the inability of moral virtue to govern the world.” The Age of Reason In
            place of revelation, myth, the Bible, and the miraculous, Paine
            substitutes nature to substantiate his religious beliefs. He acknowledges
            “that there is a power superior to all… and that power is God.” Yet he
            denies the traditional arguments of Christian theology. Aspects that make
            Paine’s style effective: Apt use of anecdote Humor Oversimplification
            Effective metaphor and imagery Rhetorical devices such as: alliteration,
            repetition, summary. WAR WITH BRITAIN Only through adroit political
            management did America succeed in avoiding involvement in the war between
            France and Britain between 1793 and 1815. The peace ended in 1812 when the
            United States went to war with Britain following the latter’s continued
            interference with American trade and shipping: in 1814 the British
            captured the city of Washington and burnt the Capitol and other government
            buildings. A fervent tide of nationalist sentiment followed and many
            Americans volunteered to fight against the British. The war ended in 1814
            with very little gained by either side, although Americans had acquired
            new self confidence and unity. THE ‘ERA OF GOOD FEELING’ The peaceful
            period which followed the war is sometimes known as ‘The Era of Good
            Feeling’, imbued as it was with a spirit of unity, optimism and peace. By
            1819 the population had grown from 3, 240, 000 to over 9 million. America
            concentrated on its own affairs, adopting, in 1816, a form of economic
            protectionism known as the ‘American System’. Under this system domestic
            manufacturers benefited from the tariffs imposed on imported goods. A new
            Bank of the United States was chartered in the same year and the transport
            system (most notably the National Road) was improved; many national
            building projects were undertaken. New territories in the form of the Red
            River Basin and Florida were added in 1818 and 1819 respectively. This
            prevailing spirit of optimism and wellbeing was, however, undermined by an
            issue which was later to prove decisive in affecting the course of events:
            slavery. In contrast to their southern neighbours, many northerners
            increasingly saw slavery as an abomination and began strongly hinting at
            its eventual abolition. The retired Jefferson correctly interpreted the
            growing conflict between the two parties as an indication of imminent
            disaster. It was, he said, ‘like a fireball in the night’. The spirit of
            nationalism uniting the American people after 1812 was, then, tempered by
            an opposing tendency towards sectionalism based on conflicting economic
            and social outlooks in different parts of the country. LITERARY CONTEXT
            Political independence preceded by a good number of years literary
            autonomy in the United States, and it was still to be some time before
            American writers were in a position to speak of a truly ‘national’
            literature. English models continued to prevail, especially in the south,
            and writers found it difficult to compete with British authors, whose
            works were sold in inexpensive editions all over the country. There was a
            sense that other things were of greater importance than literature during
            this age of transition. General Washington argued that American genius was
            scientific rather than imaginative, a view which Franklin did much
            encourage. An important landmark in the development of an independent
            cultural identity was the publication of the first American dictionary in
            1806. Its compiler, Noah Webster, insisted that American usage was as good
            as British usage, and argued that, ‘As an independent nation, our honor
            requires us to have a system of language as well as in government.’
            Despite the differences between north and south, demand for a national
            literature began to grow as the country developed a more united sense of
            identity. Before 1800 Franklin had attracted international attention, but
            more as a scientist and statesman than as a writer. Only with Washington
            Irving (1783-1859) did the United States gain its first truly
            internationally recognized author of prose. As the English novelist
            Thackeray was to remark, ‘Irving was the first ambassador whom the New
            World of letters sent to the Old.’ New York was becoming the centre of
            literary activity in America at the time, and Irving – a New Yorker
            himself – established his reputation with a collection of satirical essays
            and poems on the inhabitants of Manhattan in The Salmagundi Papers (1807).
            The Satirical Knickerbocker’s History of New York (1809) confirmed his
            talents, but it was with the publication of The Sketch Book ten years
            later that his international reputation was secured. While dealing with
            American themes, many of the essays and tales contained within his volume
            took their inspiration from old European folk stories: Rip Van Winkle and
            The Legend of Sleepy Hollow are among the most famous tales in his book.
            Thus Irving is credited with showing that the short story was the American
            literary form par excellence. The novel also made its first appearance in
            America during this period. William Hill Brown (1765-1793) wrote an
            epistolary novel about tragic, incestuous love called Power of Sympathy
            (1789). Close to the English novelist, Richardson, in its sentimental
            style, it was the first American novel to be published. Modelling his
            works on the Gothic novels of late eighteenth-century England, Charles
            Brockden Brown (1771-1810) is known as the ‘Father of the American novel’.
            Horror and terror are characteristics of his works, the most famous of
            which are Wieland (1798) and Edgar Huntley (1799). With one notable
            exception, William Cullen Bryant (1794-1878), very little was achieved in
            the field of poetry during these years. Bryant was known as the ‘American
            Wordsworth’. He was heavily influenced first by Pope and then by the
            English Romantics, in particular those of the so called ‘Graveyard
            School’. At the age of only 17 he wrote his most famous poem, Thanatopsis
            (Greek for ‘a view of death’), but it was not published until 1817. He
            secured his reputation with the publication of Poems in 1821.</p>

        <p> 7. THE
            LITERATURE OF REASON AND REVOLUTION The 18th century in America – the Age
            of Reason, the Age of Neoclassicism, and the Age of Engligthenment. New
            men – scientists, religious rationalists, political philosophers – cool to
            organized religion and critical of governments. Ideas – rooted in the
            classical worlds of Greece and Rome, in the Renaissance and the Protestant
            Reformation. The Age of Reason – developed first in the 17th century
            England, spread through France and Europe, and finally came to the English
            colonies in America in the 18th century. Descartes (1596 – 1727) –
            rejection of medieval authoritarianism. An age of great discoverers –
            Isaac Newton – revealed that the universe is not a mystery moving at the
            whim of an inscrutable God but a mechanism operating by a rational formula
            that can be understood by any intelligent man or woman. Men of the Age of
            Reason sought order everywhere in the natural world – and found it, not in
            religion but in the new science. Tomas Paine declared that proof of God is
            not to be found in the Bible but in nature, that perfect expression of
            God’s omnipotent goodness. Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Thomas
            Paine – continued to doubt miracles and scriptural revelation. They
            believed in reason rather than in saints. From Theism to Deism People
            started to believe that human society must also operate by natural laws.
            The idea of progress – one of the dominant concepts of the age. There
            arose movements for social betterment, for humanitarianism: charities,
            prison reform; sympathy for the Indian, the slave, the poor, the
            oppressed. Society became eager for political change, they sought
            salvation through rebellion. Calvinist view – mankind of innately evil
            (original sin) – attacked John Locke’s view – tabula rasa (human beings
            were born neither good nor bad; all was the result of experience. Writers
            took their literary models and critical maxims from Greek and Roman
            literary works (classic – neoclassicism) The ancient ideals of clarity,
            decorum, and regularity became the measures of 18th century art.
            Literature was to avoid the ornate, the extravagant, the bombastic.
            Writing was to exhibit “clear sense” and “mathematical plainness”. Prose
            should approach the rhythm of cultivated speech; Poetry should be written
            in the measured cadances of the heroic couplet; Drama should observe the
            unities of time, place, and action. In 1783, the year the United States
            achieved its independence, Noah Webster declared, “America must be as
            independent in literature as she is in politics, as famous for the arts as
            for arms.” The first American novel, William Hill Brown’s The Power of
            Sympathy, did not appear until 1789. The first popular American novel,
            Susanna Rowson’s Charlotte Temple (1791), was first published in England.
            Both were based vaguely on American events, but they followed closely the
            tradition established by the English novelist Samuel Richardson, whose
            Pamela (1740) set a standard for didactic sentimentalism that long
            dominated American fiction. The moral temper of the colonies discouraged
            development of drama. A Pennsylvania law of 1700 prohibited stage plays
            and other “rude and riotous” sports.” Theater – indecent and corrupting,
            “dangerous to the soul of men” Professional actors – thought to spread
            sickness, immorality and lice. The first American play (Thomas Godfrey’s
            The Prince of Parthia) was not presented until 1767. While imaginative
            literature in America remained derivative and dependent, the heroic
            revolutionary ambitions of the age were creating great political
            pamphleteering and state papers.</p>

        <p> 8. THE PERIOD OF ROMANTICISM (1820s –
            1860s) HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT THE DRIVE WESTWARDS The early to mid
            1800s are characterized by a geographical expansion westwards on the part
            of the American people. Attracted by the prospect of good farmland, rich
            mineral and forest resources, and, in some cases, by greater religious
            freedom, thousands of settlers moved over the Appalachian Mountains into
            unknown territories, continually pushing the frontier westwards. By the
            1830s settlers were moving west beyond the Mississippi river into eastern
            Texas, Iowa, Missouri and Arkansas. The next decade witnessed still
            further movement west across the Great Plains to the rich farmland and
            forests of the Far West. Most of these courageous and resilient pioneers
            became farmers and landowners, although this movement of the population
            inevitably led to urban development too: towns and cities sprang up along
            the trails, providing opportunities for trade and commercial expansion. In
            ever greater numbers, Americans came to believe in what had been termed
            ‘Manifest Destiny’, a doctrine which held that the United States should
            control the whole of North America. During the 1840s the pioneers settled
            in lands as far west as California and Oregon Country, which belonged to
            Mexico and Britain respectively. Texas was annexed in 1845 following
            appeals on the part of its inhabitants for intervention against its
            corrupt and tyrannical Mexican government. American forces defeated the
            Mexicans in the brief war which followed and in 1848 Texas, together with
            California and a vast area of land known as New Mexico, became part of the
            United States. The decimation of Indian tribes at the hands of both
            pioneers and American soldiers was an unfortunate consequence of this
            expansion westwards. Those who survived were moved west of the Mississippi
            river. By 1854 an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Europe helped to
            swell the number of people living in the thirty-one states which then made
            up America to as many as 22.5 million. EARLY- MID-CENURY ECONOMIC GROWTH
            Territorial expansion was accompanied by growing economic prosperity
            during these formative years for American society, and before the end of
            the century the United States was to become the world’s leading
            agricultural nation. Agricultural surpluses – especially cotton – were
            exported abroad to Europe at high prices. Farmers grew tobacco, wheat,
            corn and fruit in huge quantities on the rich farmlands and took advantage
            of new farming methods and machines. Transport was expanded and improved
            in the form of canals (the Erie canal was opened in 1825) and roads (the
            National Road in the east and Oregon and Santa Fe trails in the west).
            Both the steamboat and, later, the steam powered railroad were to prove
            decisive in America’s commercial success: by 1850, 14 500 km of railroad
            were in operation, thus assisting the speedy delivery of industrial goods
            and merchandise all over the nation. Improvements in agriculture were
            matched by those in industry. Manual labour continued to predominate for
            some time, although developments in large scale manufacturing –
            particularly in the East – were beginning to take place. An expanded
            postal system combined with the new telegraph to provide a quick and
            efficient means of communication. Information became more widely available
            to people as improvements were made to printing methods, and an ever
            increasing reading public gladly took to a steadily growing and more
            self-confident national literature. SOCIAL CONCERNS Social reform - a
            pressing issue; Improvements in prison and asylum conditions took place;
            Tentative efforts were made to reduce the working day (from 14 to 10
            hours); Education - a major concern; Women’s rights became an important
            issue; The most significant issue - SLAVERY. HOME AFFAIRS The period was
            dominated by Andrew Jackson, leader of the newly founded Democratic Party
            and champion of the common man. Whereas all preceding Presidents of the
            United States had come from wealthy eastern families, Jackson had grown up
            as a poor child in a log cabin, and his election as President in 1828 and
            1832 was largely made possible by the support of western farmers and
            settlers and members of the manual laboring classes in the city. His
            promises to eliminate privileged politics and establish a more equal
            distribution of political power became known as ‘Jacksonian democracy’.
            LITERARY CONTEXT A CONTRAST BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH - most writers of the
            period were working in New England (despite the English influence some
            authors succeeded in producing some of America’s finest and most memorable
            literature). Few signs of a ‘Southern School’ developing; (English
            Romantic models were more closely adhered to in the South). BASIC NOTIONS
            Romanticism is considered by many the real beginning of American
            literature; Emphasis upon the imaginative and emotional qualities of
            literature; Nature – a refuge from the constraints of society; A liking
            for the picturesque, the exotic, the sensuous, and the supernatural; A
            strong tendency to exalt the individual and the common man. The aesthetic
            vision of the Hudson River School of painters is believed to have been
            influenced by Romanticism. Frederic Edwin Church - Rainy Season in the
            Tropics Albert Bierstadt - Mount Corcoran NEW ENGLAND TRANSCENDENTALISM
            Romanticism on Puritan soil; Flourished in New England (1830s – The Civil
            War); Transcendentalists took their ideas from European Romantic
            literature, German Idealistic philosophy, Oriental mysticism… A fresh
            perception of nature as symbolic of the spirit or God; Feeling over
            reason; Individual expression over the restraints of law and custom; The
            stress of the importance of the individual as the most important element
            of society; Against the materialism of American society; They believed in
            the transcendence of the Oversoul, an all pervading power for goodness
            from which all things come and of which all things are part. Ralph Waldo
            Emerson (1803–1882) The central figure of the American Transcendentalists;
            Key belief - each individual could transcend, or move beyond, the physical
            world of the senses into deeper spiritual experience through free will and
            intuition. God is not remote and unknowable; believers understood God and
            themselves by looking into their own souls and by feeling their own
            connection to nature. Man is a part of absolute good. In the 1840s Emerson
            founded and co-edited the literary magazine The Dial, and he published two
            volumes of essays. "The Over-Soul" (1841) - an essay. “Self-Reliance”
            (1841) - his most well-known essays (the reader is asked to examine his
            relationship with Nature and God and to trust his own judgment). “Nature"
            (1836) and “Experience”. (1844) – other essays. Henry David Thoreau
            (1817–1862) Philosopher, Journalist, Poet A basic representative of
            Transcendentalism and a close friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882)
            "Walden“, subtitled "Life in the Woods"(1854) - his most famous work, an
            account of the two years he spent living the simple life in the woods at
            Walden Pond; “Resistance to Civil Government“, often reprinted with the
            title "Civil Disobedience“(1849) - his most influential essay, in which he
            recommended disobeying unjust laws; "The Maine Woods" and "Excursions“ -
            travel books (published after his death); His huge "Journal", accumulated
            over 24 years, was published in 14 volumes in 1906. From "Civil
            Disobedience“ (1849): I have paid no poll-tax for six years. I was put
            into a jail once on this account, for one night; and, as I stood
            considering the walls of solid stone, two or three feet thick, the door of
            wood and iron, a foot thick, and the iron grating which strained the
            light, I could not help being struck with the foolishness of that
            institution which treated me as if I were mere flesh and blood and bones,
            to be locked up… I did not for a moment feel confined, and the walls
            seemed a great waste of stone and mortar. I felt as if I alone of all my
            townsmen had paid my tax… I saw that the State was half-witted, that it
            was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons, and that it did not know
            its friends from its foes, and I lost all my remaining respect for it, and
            pitied it. Thus the State never intentionally confronts a man's sense,
            intellectual or moral, but only his body, his senses. It is not armed with
            superior wit or honesty, but with superior physical strength. ********
            There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State
            comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from
            which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him
            accordingly.</p>

        <p> 9. AMERICAN ROMANTICISM THE NOVEL FOCUS: AMERICAN
            ROMANTICISM: THE NOVEL; JAMES FENIMORE COOPER; HERMAN MELVILLE; NATHANIEL
            HAWTHORNE. The novel - a very important part of American Romanticism;
            Experimentation with form and breaking with many literary conventions;
            Symbolism; Nature – a central theme; Individualism and imagination;
            Emotion; Democracy and freedom; The frontier as a place (and as an idea) –
            a central theme. JAMES FENIMORE COOPER (1789-1851) Significance: The
            founding father of the American historical novel; The creator of the myth
            of the American West. J. F. Cooper is the FIRST… - … to create a massive
            body of work. - … to be a professional writer. - … to regard literature as
            a commentary on and corrective of culture. - … to create a complex and
            enduring myth of American life. - … American novelist of manners. J. F.
            Cooper is the inventor of three types of novel: 1. The novel of the
            frontier; 2. The novel of the sea; 3. The international novel (in which
            European and American culture collide). Basic Works Precaution (1820) a
            novel of morals and manners that showed the influence of Jane Austen; The
            Spy: A Tale of Neutral Ground (1821) the first historical romance about
            the American Revolution; In New York City, Cooper founded the Bread and
            Cheese Club and became the center of a circle that included notable
            painters (Hudson River School) and writers. The Leatherstocking Tales The
            Leatherstocking Tales is a series of five novels about 18th-century life
            among Indians and white pioneers on the New York State frontier. The main
            character is Natty Bumppo, who takes on various names throughout the
            series, one of which – the Leatherstocking:  The Pioneers (1823) The
            Prairie (1827) The Last of the Mohicans (1826) The Pathfinder (1840) The
            Deerslayer (1841) The American frontier – a place where the Old World and
            the New World collide. The dangers are great, but this is also a place
            that offers a second chance to humanity – to live in heaven, to restore
            the harmony with nature, and be reborn. With the constant movement of the
            frontier westwards, Cooper sees this heaven disappearing, destroying the
            people of the forest – the Indians. The cowboy western relies on Cooper’s
            literary techniques and conventions (mighty warriors, almost supernatural
            protection of the hero from a serious injury, the quest,…) Cooper’s
            portrayal of nature is comparable to that of the Hudson River School
            painters (harmony, vast panoramas, minute human and animal figures…)
            Emphasis on action and adventure, rather than psychological complexities.
            Natty Bumppo The main character in The Leatherstocking Tales. An
            unprecedented American hero of the frontier – true to Christianity and
            civilization but respecting the Indians and nature. A white man who has no
            Indian blood but has lived so long with them that he is caught between two
            worlds. Significant not as realistic but symbolic character. A fictional
            prototype of the western heroes in popular American fiction and film.
            Cooper and the Sea The History of the Navy of the United States of
            America (1839) - history; Lives of Distinguished American Naval
            Officers (1846) – biography; The Pilot (1824), The Red Rover (1828),
            Afloat and Ashore (1844) – novels of the sea. Contrastive Reception
            Influential to European writers, but frequently criticized by his
            fellow-countrymen; Returning from Europe, Cooper was so hurt by a review
            that he penned A Letter to His Countrymen, which was a bitter attack on
            American provincialism; Criticized about his dialogues, identical female
            character and flat Indian characters; Mark Twain tore apart Fenimore's
            romanticism in Fenimore Cooper’s Literary Offenses (1895). HERMAN MELVILLE
            (1819 – 1891) His forebears - leading roles in the American Revolution;
            The family enjoyed a prosperous life; When they moved to Albany, their
            business suffered a big hit; After his father died, the eldest son,
            Gansevoort, assumed responsibility for the family and took over their
            business. Herman joined him after two years. Herman attended Albany
            Academy and Albany Classical School and started writing poems, essays and
            short stories. Wanderings And Voyages 1837 - Herman shipped out as cabin
            boy on a merchant ship; 1841 - embarked on his second sea voyage, on the
            whaler Acushnet; After 18 months onboard, Melville deserted and lived with
            the natives of the Marquesas Islands; He then arrived in Tahiti and
            finally Honolulu, Hawaii. Writings of Sea Adventures Typee: A Peep at
            Polynesian Life (1846);  Omoo: A Narrative of Adventures in the South Seas
            (1847);  Redburn: His First Voyage (1849); White-Jacket; or, The World in
            a Man-of-War (1850); Moby-Dick (initially titled The Whale) (1851).
            Moby-Dick Traveling from Nantucket, Massachusetts, to South America,
            the Essex met its doom in the Pacific Ocean, when a sperm whale attacked
            and destroyed the ship. The crew, adrift in their small whaleboats, faced
            storms, thirst, illness and starvation, and were even reduced to
            cannibalism for survival. However, succeeding in one of the great
            open-boat journeys of all time, the few survivors were picked up off South
            America. Their story, spread widely in America in the 19th century,
            provided inspiration for Melville's tale of a ship captain seeking revenge
            on an elusive whale. The opening of the novel is considered to be one of
            the most iconic in American literature: Call me Ishmael. Some years ago -
            never mind how long precisely - having little or no money in my purse, and
            nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
            little and see the watery part of the world… (p. 3) A Wide Range of

            Encyclopedic elements A mixture of various styles Adventure story Man vs.
            monster Psychological thriller Universal themes (religion, fate, revenge,
            human nature…) Moby-Dick sold poorly, as did subsequent novels and
            Melville was about to give up on writing novels. Pierre; or, The
            Ambiguities (1852) Israel Potter: His Fifty Years of Exile (1855) The

            York City; Turned his creative interests to poetry, publishing the
            collection Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866); Clarel: A Poem and
            Pilgrimage in the Holy Land (1876) – an epic based on a previous trip to
            the region. Melville had finally begun work on another novel when he died
            of a heart attack in New York City. NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE (1804–1864) FROM
            TRANSCENDENTALISM TO DARK ROMATICISM Hawthorne was a founding member
            of Brook Farm, a utopian experiment in communal living. He fictionalized
            the experiences of Brook Farm in his satirical novel The Blithedale
            Romance (1852). Hawthorne changes from a young transcendental idealist to
            a Dark Romantic writer. The Scarlet Letter (1850) One of the first
            mass-produced novels in America and became an instant bestseller; Praised
            for its sentimentality and moral purity; Set in 17th-century Puritan
            Massachusetts Bay Colony, during the years 1642 to 1649; Tells the story
            of Hester Prynne, who conceives a daughter through an affair and is
            stigmatized by the Puritan society; Explores themes of sin, hypocrisy and
            guilt. The House of Seven Gables (1851) - a novel about a New England
             family and their ancestral home, which explores themes of guilt,
            retribution, and atonement and colors the tale with suggestions of the
            supernatural and witchcraft. He also wrote short stories: My Kinsman,
            Major Molineaux (1832), Young Goodman Brown (1835), Feathertop (1852) …</p>

        <p>      10. AMERICAN ROMANTICISM POETRY FOCUS: 19th CENTURY POETRY - THE NEW
            ENGLAND BRAHMINS; WALT WHITMAN; EMILY DICKINSON; EDGAR ALLAN POE. 1. The
            New England Brahmins The New England Brahmins (AKA: Cambridge Poets,
            America’s Schoolroom, Household Poets or Fireside Poets) – a group of New
            England authors associated with Harvard and Cambridge, Massachusetts, who
            were educated in Europe aristocrats, steeped into foreign culture. They
            were professors at Harvard and made Boston the literary capital.
            Characteristics: Use of traditional poetic subject and forms; Regular and
            familiar rhythms; High moral standards of behavior; Celebration of the
            family and the domestic life. The Fireside Poets were very popular in the
            19th century, but their popularity declined in the 20th and 21st century,
            because of the changes in the beliefs, and poetic style. Representatives:
            James Russell Lowell (1819 – 1891) The archetypal New England man of
            letters with various literary talents; A poet, critic, essayist, editor,
            and diplomat; Graduated from Harvard with a degree in law;
            Published Conversations on Some of the Old Poets (1845)- a collection of
            critical essays that included pleas for the abolition of slavery; Wrote
            about 50 antislavery articles for periodicals. His Biglow Papers (1846-48)
            - a set of satirical verses in which Lowell uses a humor and original
            Yankee dialect to express his opposition to the Mexican War as an attempt
            to extend the area of slavery. A number of anti-slavery poems before the
            Civil War. Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894) American physician, poet and
            humorist; The ‘Breakfast-Table’ papers – a series of essays first
            published in The Atlantic Monthly; A number of poems which appealed to
            popular tastes of the day; Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) The
            leading Cambridge poet and the most popular one; Heavily influenced by
            European culture and writing; Much of his verse tends to be derivative and
            conforms to the popular literary tastes of the day; His most famous poem,
            The Song of Hiawatha (1855), deals with the legend of the American
            Indians; The Tales of a Wayside Inn - modeled roughly on Geoffrey
            Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. 2. Walt Whitman (1819-1892) A pioneer poet,
            essayist, journalist and humanist, he is considered to be part of the
            transition between transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views
            in his work. Walt Whitman was Dutch on his mother’s side and New England
            British on his father’s. He grew up on Long Island. In 1823 his family
            moved to Brooklyn. His later poetry is filled with the sights and sounds
            of country and city which impressed him so deeply as a child. By birth a
            poet of the people; Limited formal education; His education came from his
            various jobs in printing shops and newspapers; His occupations also
            included: a painter, schoolteacher, reporter, editor; One of the most
            highly individual and important authors in the history of American
            literature; The publication of Leaves of Grass in 1855 represented a
            revolutionary departure in American verse, both in terms of form and
            content. A firm believer in Jacksonian democracy and the splendor of the
            common man; Whitman owned much to the philosophical thought of Emerson.
            Leaves of Grass (1855) Addressed to the citizens of the United States,
            Leaves of Grass was a kind of autobiography in verse. Both prophetic and
            intimate, its glorification of democracy and the nation itself – its
            landscape and its people – was matched by an equally keen concern with the
            ideas, beliefs, experiences and emotions of the common man in an age which
            celebrated the value of individualism. This exaltation of the individual –
            in a physical as well as spiritual sense – commonly takes the form of the
            ‘I’ in his poems, and yet Whitman was keen to stress that each person is
            contained in all other people in a kind of mystical unity of personality.
            Whitman was a pioneer in terms of technical innovation. He experimented
            with free verse in an attempt to liberate American poetry from the
            restrictions and rules of traditional stanza and rhyme forms. His
            so-called long line contained a variable number of unstressed syllables
            and no strictly fixed meter, and he organized his stanzas into what he
            called ‘verse paragraphs’. In later editions of Leaves of Grass Whitman’s
            poems took on a more mature and pessimistic outlook: the Civil War
            affected him deeply, a the group of poems called Drum Taps testify, and
            his famous elegy on the death of President Lincoln, When Lilacs Last in
            the Dooryard Bloom’d (1865), betrayed a sense of anguished resignation and
            grief. Some critics have argued that Whitman was primarily an egoist and
            sensualist, that his ego and vast sensual craving found their expression
            in his poetic celebration of the self, and that his constant desire to
            expand the boundaries of the self ultimately led him to identify himself
            with the cosmos. However, Whitman’s “I” is not only Whitman himself but
            his idea of the representative man. Whitman teaches that humanity is
            naturally good, and he identifies with all humanity. He considered each of
            his poems to be a separate leaf or ‘blade’ of grass because they were
            divine (though common), because they were symbolic of life and cycles of
            birth and death, and because they were significant both individually and
            in the mass. SONG OF MYSELF [16] I am of old and young, of the foolish as
            much as the wise, Regardless of others, ever regardful of others, Maternal
            as well as paternal, a child as well as a man, Stuff'd with the stuff that
            is coarse and stuff'd with the stuff that is fine, One of the Nation of
            many nations, the smallest the same and the largest the same, A Southerner
            as soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable down by the
            Oconee I live, … QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION In what ways is the poem
            different from other poems? How many contradictions do you see? What’s
            Whitman’s attitude to his country? 3. Emily Dickinson (1830 – 1886) Emily
            Dickinson and Walt Whitman – the greatest poets of 19th –century America –
            both highly individualistic, though Whitman’s individualism was public,
            while Dickinson’s was private. Both saw physical everyday things as
            symbols of spiritual things. Both rebelled against the poetic conventions
            of rhythm, meter and rhyme of their time. Both were forerunners of
            20th-century poets. But Dickinson’s ‘sense of limitation’ contrasts
            Whitman’s expansiveness; where Whitman was optimistic, Dickinson saw life
            as difficult, painful, and filled with losses – or with gains that were
            temporary and costly. She wrote about 1,775 poems (which she called ‘her
            letter to the world’); Her works remained almost completely unknown during
            her lifetime; Short and beautifully crafted poems; Experimental rhythm and
            rhyme; Enigmatic images and metaphor; Love, death and the natural universe
            are the main themes. Dickinson’s poetry reflects a Calvinistic sense of
            evil and the inevitability of spiritual struggle. Notable motifs in her
            poetry include: - A sense of loss - The idea of nature as both threat and
            a source of joy and comfort - The ecstasy and the dangers of love - The
            tension between faith and doubt - A fascination with death Her nature
            images express both a delight in nature, suggestive of New England
            transcendentalism, and a Calvinistic sense of evil in nature. Some readers
            might find her poetry morbid and oppressive because of its emphasis on: -
            Fear and anguish - Renunciation and loss - Sickness and starvation - Pain
            and death Critic Irvin Ehrenpreis comments about Dickinson that she “wrote
            not about immortality but our hope for immortality, not about nature but
            our separation from nature, not about God but our belief in God … It was
            the defeat of love by circumstance – by jealousy, egotism, illness, death
            – that drove her to doubt the existence of God and to yarn for a trust in
            immortality” (1975:4). Apparently with no surprise To any happy Flower The
            Frost beheads it at its play - In accidental power -   The blonde Assassin
            passes on -        The Sun proceeds unmoved To measure off another day For
            an Approving God. [1884] QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION What is the main theme
            of the poem? What do you think of the image of the sun? 4. Edgar Allan
            Poe (1809–1849) Writer, poet and critic; A key representative of Dark
            Romanticism; Famous for his tales and poems of horror, mystery and
            suspense; Master of the Macabre; Father of the detective story. Inventor
            of the Detective Story       In 1841, Poe published the first modern
            detective story The Murders in the Rue Morgue.  In this tale, Poe
            established the basis in which succeeding mystery writers would follow.
            The first step to this basis is to provide a seemingly impossible crime.
            In The Murders in the Rue Morgue, a double murder takes place inside a
            room that is locked from the inside. The next step in the mystery writing
            process is to have the detective character analyze the clues in order to
            solve the mystery. To explain to the audience just how intelligent the
            detective is, the narrator is not the detective but his less intelligent
            partner.  So assured of his own powers of analysis was Poe that in his
            tale The Mystery of Marie Roget, he claimed to have solved a real-life
            crime that had baffled the New York City police.  This would be the first
            detective story based on a true crime.  Poe’s Thou Art the Man became the
            first comic detective story and the first mystery in which the culprit
            turned out to be “the least likely suspect.”     Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,
            the author of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries wrote, “Where was the
            detective story before Poe breathed the breath of life into it?” Doyle
            considered Poe to be the father of the detective genre.      Pioneer of
            Science Fiction      In 1835, Poe published Hans Phaall, A Tale the story
            of a trip to the moon.  Although other writers had written
            fantastic stories, Poe added realistic scientific details to make his
            stories more believable. Throughout his career Poe wrote stories about the
            limits of technology.  In The Facts in the Case of M. Vademar a doctor is
            able to communicate with a man whose body had already died.  This tale was
            so realistic that it was reprinted in a medical journal in England.     
            Master of the Psychological Horror Story      Much of Poe’s popular appeal
            rests on a few of his tales of terror, but the horror genre has frequently
            been ignored or derided by critics.  This was the case even in Poe’s
            day. Poe believed terror was a part of life and therefore a legitimate
            subject for literature. By Poe’s time, Gothic fiction had already been
            popularized by Horace Walpole and Charles Brockman Brown. Their tales
            typically centered on family curses and haunted castles.  Poe’s first
            published tale Metzengerstein falls into this genre, but in Poe’s next
            horror tales he would move the action away from a remote castle and into
            an everyday setting like a home (The Tell-Tale Heart, The Black Cat) or a
            school (William Wilson).   Even when Poe set his horror tale in a distant
            land he focused less on the location than on the psychology of his
            characters.  Poe also wrote about the subjects that were generating
            newspaper headlines in his day— murders, premature burials, and grave
            robberies. Author H.P. Lovecraft devoted an entire chapter of his book
            Supernatural Horror in Literature (1935) to Poe.    Poe’s tales of terror
            remain among his most popular and have influenced later horror writers
            like Steven King and H.P. Lovecraft.  Filmmakers Alfred Hitchcock and
            Dario Argento have acknowledged that Poe’s horror tales were among their
            initial inspirations.       America’s First Great Literary Critic      Poe
            is considered America’s first great literary critic.  During his lifetime,
            American authors were generally considered inferior to their
            British counterparts, and many American authors imitated British
            literature.  As a critic, Poe frequently attacked authors he considered
            guilty of imitation, and he was often the first to accuse an author of
            plagiarism if their work too closely resembled that of another author. 
            The popular American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was a favorite
            target.  Poe’s tendency to ridicule those he considered inferior writers
            offended many of the most important authors and editors of his day,
            including Rufus Griswold, who would later write Poe’s biography.  Poe’s
            reviews were not, however, all negative.  He called a young Nathaniel
            Hawthorne “a man of the truest genius” (Review of Twice-Told
            Tales, Graham’s Magazine, May 1842), and he wrote that “it is scarcely
            possible to speak of [“The Old Curiosity Shop” by Charles Dickens] too
            well.”  Poe so admired the poetry of Elizabeth Barrett Browning that he
            dedicated his book The Raven and Other Poems to her.      When judging the
            quality of an author’s work, Poe also explained his definition of good
            writing.  In his May 1842 review of Hawthorne, Poe defined the criteria by
            which he reviewed a short story.  He said such a work should be original
            and should have an emotional impact on the reader.  Poe thought that the
            entire story should be composed with that emotional impact in mind.  If
            one were to take breaks in the middle of reading, the emotional impact the
            story is intended to evoke would be diluted by all the distractions of the
            real world.   </p>

            FOCUS: THE CIVIL WAR; POST-WAR AMERICA; LOCAL COLORISM THE CIVIL WAR
            (1861-1865) The most significant issue of the century was slavery. All
            northern states had abolished slavery by the early 1800s, but the
            plantation system of farming in the South depended on a cheap labor force
            for its economic survival, and black slaves were therefore indispensable.
            Denouncing the ‘peculiar institution’ of slavery as a moral sin, the
            abolitionist movement gained strength particularly in the New England
            states, and southerners became more and more convinced that federal
            government would eventually outlaw it. During the 1830s some southern
            leaders justified the existence of slavery by arguing that whites were
            superior to blacks and that their status as slaves was perfectly suited to
            their natural condition, an argument that found many supporters in the
            South. This very delicate question rapidly became the issue of a sectional
            quarrel whose roots lay in the different economic and social structure of
            the North and South. It was later to lead to the outbreak of civil war.
            The ongoing dispute between North and South over the issue of slavery came
            to a head in the 1850s. The vast areas of land conquered in the West had
            to be split up into territories and then states. This meant that the
            delicate constitutional balance in the Senate between free states and
            slave states – achieved by means of the Missouri Compromise in 1820 –
            would once again be at risk. The newly formed states would have to declare
            themselves in favor of slavery or its abolition, and the painstakingly
            earned political status quo would be overthrown. When California applied
            for statehood in 1849 a fierce debate ensued as to whether it should be a
            free state or a slave state: northerners favored the former and
            southerners the latter solution. Compromise was reached a year later:
            California would be admitted as a free state and in Washington slavery
            would be abolished. In order to satisfy the southern states Congress
            created two new territories, New Mexico and Utah, and ruled that residents
            would decide whether or not to become slave state when they were given
            full statehood. The problem rose again in the early 1850s when Congress
            began considering the creation of new territories between Missouri and
            present-day Idaho. Flagrantly ignoring the requirements of the Missouri
            Compromise that slavery would be ‘forever prohibited’ in all the territory
            gained from Louisiana Purchase north of Missouri’s southern border,
            Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854: two territories – Kansas
            and Nebraska – were created west of Missouri and the people were to be
            allowed to decide for themselves as to their future status as free or
            slave states. With this controversial measure popular sovereignty took
            precedence over congressional edict. The effects of this Act were
            calamitous and the country was thrown into social and political turmoil. A
            group of ‘free soil’ and anti-slavery advocates formed the Republican
            Party in 1854 and were joined by sympathizers from both the Democratic and
            the Whig parties. A new party called the Know Nothing Party attracted the
            support of Americans seeking simpler answers to a very complicated
            question. Political disintegration was accompanied by a split among church
            groups, while the Supreme Court – a highly respected American institution
            – lost credibility in the North as a result of the Dred-Scott Decision in
            1857: blacks, it was held, were not citizens and the laws limiting the
            spread of slavery were unconstitutional. The compactness of the Union was
            in great danger of disintegrating. Social disorder and fighting between
            pro- and anti-slavery groups became commonplace. The publication of
            Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin in 1851 served to inflame public
            opinion still further: Initially published in serial form in the National
            Era, an anti-slavery paper in Washington; The novel was highly influential
            in stirring up popular feeling against slavery, and was cited by Lincoln
            as one of the main causes of the Civil War. The impact of the book lies in
            its illustration of slavery’s effects on families, and to help readers
            empathize with enslaved characters. Uncle Tom’s Cabin contributed to the
            outbreak of war by personalizing the political and economic arguments
            about slavery. Conversational writing style, which inspired people.
            Harriet Elisabeth Beecher Stowe (1811 – 1896) The election of Republican
            Party candidate, Abraham Lincoln, to the Presidency of the United States
            in 1860 was to prove unacceptable to southerners because of his staunch
            anti-slavery views, and in December of that year South Carolina seceded
            from the Union. Six other southern states took the same decision a month
            later and together they formed the Confederate States of America. Five
            more states, including Texas and Virginia, joined the confederacy later,
            in 1861: the Union was well and truly split down the middle. Once in
            office Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy and insisted they had
            no right to leave the Union, which was to be preserved at all costs. By
            April 1861 Confederate forces were at war with those of the Union: the
            American Civil War had begun. Better organized and financed, the soldiers
            of the Union gradually wore down the spirited forces of the Confederacy,
            led by the courageous general Robert E. Lee. In 1865 General Ulysses Grant
            forced Lee’s surrender in Virginia. The Civil war cost the country dear:
            it has been estimated that approximately 360,000 Union troops and 260,000
            Confederates died during the conflict – more than in any other war in
            which Americans have participated. Cities, roads, factories and
            plantations were left in ruins in the South, and feelings of bitterness
            between Southerners and Northerners were to long outlast the boom of the
            ferocious cannons. RECONSTRUCTION After the war a period of rebuilding
            known as Reconstruction began in the war-torn South. Disagreement among
            the Northerners as to when and under what conditions Confederate states
            should be re-admitted to the Union led to a split among politicians.
            Northern moderates sought mild treatment of offenders while the radicals
            looked for more severe forms of punishment and greater guarantees for
            blacks. Lincoln’s attempts to pacify the two factions were cut short by
            John Wilkes Booth who assassinated him one week after the war ended.
            Andrew Johnson, his successor, was unable to placate the fury of the
            radicals and was forced to bow to their wishes in the program of
            reconstruction. Much to the dismay of the Southerners, troops were sent to
            occupy the South and Republican politicians took over local government in
            the area. Confederate states were forced to accept and follow all federal
            laws before being allowed back into the Union. By 1870 the Union was once
            again complete, all ex-Confederate states having returned to the fold.
            Congress passed the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the
            constitution in an attempt to further the rights of blacks in America: the
            thirteenth amendment (1865) abolished slavery in the United States, the
            fourteenth (1868) confirmed the citizenship of blacks and the fifteenth
            (1870) made it illegal to deny the right to vote on the basis of race. All
            these measures aroused resentment on the part of Southerners. THE EFFECTS
            OF THE RECONSTRUCTION Reconstruction can only be said to have been
            partially successful. Although legally free, the majority of blacks who
            remained in the South continued their lives much as before, and Congress
            was unable to provide them with any form of social and economic security.
            Indeed, violence and intimidation (the Ku Klux Klan had its beginnings in
            this period) on the part of desperate whites ensured there was very little
            progress in terms of human rights, and black rights was to remain a highly
            delicate issue for generations to come. Defeat in the Civil War also meant
            the end of certain way of life in the South: many of the great plantation
            owners were forced to sell their lands to small farmers and abandon their
            aristocratic southern lifestyle. INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION Post-Civil War
            American society was characterized by massive industrialization in the
            North and an astonishing growth in population. The social and economic
            problems which accompanied this expansion were met by a large number of
            political reforms as the newly united nation slowly began to find its feet
            on both the domestic and international stage. The South of the United
            States remained essentially agricultural, both blacks and whites now
            having become landowners and farmers. The American frontier began to close
            since much of the vacant land had been sold at very low prices to farmers,
            under the Homestead Act of 1862. Many of these men set up farms among the
            Great Plains which had wrongly been considered barren and infertile.
            Settlement, or the laying down of roots, also put an end to the Indian way
            of life: the buffalo herds on which many tribes depended were slaughtered
            by advancing whites and by 1900 the vast majority of Indians lived on
            reservations provided by the federal government. In a process comparable
            to the Industrial Revolution in Britain, American industry became more
            highly mechanized. Manufacturing methods became more efficient and
            productive as newer and larger factories in the growing number of
            industrial cities, particularly in the North, were organized along the
            lines of the division of labor. Machines were used in ever greater numbers
            and businesses were able to charge lower prices for the range of new
            products available: the typewriter (1867), the telephone (1876), the
            phonograph (1877) and the gasoline automobile (1885) made their first
            appearances in this period. The last one was to have an enormous impact on
            American – and world – society as Ransom Olds and Henry Ford began turning
            out mass produced vehicles. Indeed, by 1916 no less than 3.5 million
            people owned a car – as opposed to only 8,000 in 1900. America’s wealth of
            natural resources – including timber, coal, copper, silver and, most
            importantly, gasoline oil – was exploited to the full. Iron and steel
            products enabled men like Andrew Carnegie to build growing numbers of
            railroads, machines, bridges, cars and skyscrapers, and as the landscape
            of the country changed, so these self-made men joined the burgeoning ranks
            of America’s first millionaires. BIG BUSINESS The discovery of oil in
            Texas and other states assisted northern industry in its inexorable drive
            forwards and was to prove vital to the future economy of the United
            States. Business was booming. The number of banks increased rapidly, as
            did the number of people willing to invest money in capitalistic
            enterprises. The role of business owners in the political decision-making
            process was to become ever more important as time progressed, although a
            lack of regulations and laws regarding business and corporations was not
            without its problems, as the growing number of ruthless monopolies and
            trusts demonstrated. Important steps were also made in the field of
            transport and communications. Railroad construction reached its peak in
            the late 1860s with the completion of the first transcontinental railroad
            system in Utah: with the joining of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific
            railroads the United States was linked coast to coast for the first time.
            By the end of the century the railway network had spread from 14,500 km in
            1850 to an astonishing 320, 000 km, thus facilitating national
            transportation not only of passengers but of goods as well. Just as the
            railroad marked an advance on the stagecoach with regard to mail delivery,
            so the telephone gradually substituted the telegraph system, and
            communications became quicker and more reliable. AMERICAN SOCIETY Economic
            growth was in part facilitated by a growing domestic market. By 1916
            America’s population had more than doubled its 1870 level of 40 million to
            almost 100 million. Significantly, half of these people lived in towns or
            cities where business thrived and work was more readily available.
            Immigration was a prime factor in swelling the numbers of population: more
            than 25 million people from countries all over the world entered America
            between 1870 and 1920. Immigrants arriving in the ‘Promised Land’ provided
            both cheap labor and a ready market of consumers. During what Mark Twain
            called ‘The Gilded Age’, many individuals amassed huge fortunes and
            attempted to imitate the culture and manners of their upper class European
            counterparts. They built glamorous mansions, bought and imported European
            works of art, attended the opera and went to refined clubs and
            restaurants. The growing ranks of America’s middle class consisted mostly
            of small time business owners and factory or office managers. They too
            shared in the enormous quantities of wealth generated by the boom. The
            working or laboring class, however, lived for the most part in great
            poverty in crowded slums and tenement buildings with little or no
            sanitation. Disease was common, working hours were long and education
            among the poor was virtually non-existent. Unemployment due to labor
            surpluses only served to aggravate their wretched conditions during the
            depressions of 1873, 1884, 1893 and 1907. No state assistance was
            available at that time and many workers faced an enormous struggle to
            survive. What little leisure time they possessed was spent at circuses,
            vaudeville shows and sporting events. Indeed, baseball became the national
            sport, and dime novels, together with magazines and, after 1900, the
            motion pictures, helped to form a mass leisure market which changed
            relatively little up until more recent times. THE ‘PROGRESSIVE ERA’
            (1890-1917) During what is frequently referred to as the ‘Progressive Era’
            (1890-1917), reformers or ‘progressives’ as they had become known,
            succeeded in bringing about many changes. During the 1880s farmers’ unions
            successfully pressed the railroad companies to lower transport costs.
            Better wages and working conditions were obtained through the efforts of
            the American Federation of Labour (AFL), a union of skilled labourers
            formed in 1886. Strikes of varying length and effectiveness became
            increasingly common occurrence in American society, although it was not
            until the twentieth century that the situation of laborers improved to any
            great extent. Their cause was set back considerably by the Haymarket riots
            in 1886 when eight policemen died during an open rally. The National Woman
            Suffrage Association was founded in 1869, and in the same year Wyoming was
            the first territory to give women the right to vote. Other states followed
            suit afterwards, although suffrage was limited to local elections only.
            LITERARY CONTEXT As the nineteenth century drew to a close, American
            writers produced a wide variety of works, particularly in the field of
            prose. If American drama had to wait until the 1920s for its true voice in
            Eugene O’Neill, poetry was still reeling from the shock waves generated by
            Whitman, and very little of note was produced until the early decades of
            the twentieth century. As the frontier moved west to its ultimate resting
            place on the Pacific Ocean, so Americans became more inquisitive about
            people living in other parts of the country. After the Civil War, their
            curiosity was in part satisfied by a number of authors known collectively
            as ‘literary comedians’ and ‘local colorists’. LOCAL COLORISM – THE
            BEGINNING OF REALISM Wrote mainly for newspapers and magazines;
            Concentrated on colorful descriptions of local traditions, customs,
            manners, dress and – most importantly – dialects and speech; Their humor -
            mostly bound up with slang, bad spelling and incorrect grammar; Some of
            these authors wrote amusing ‘tall tales’ about exaggerated heroes and
            incidents; More serious stories and novels covering almost every corner of
            the country were written by the ‘local colorists’: in their sympathetic
            portrayal of mostly simple folk in provincial communities and their
            attention to dialect and local customs. These works in part paved the way
            for the movements of realism and naturalism which were to dominate the
            American novel over the coming decades. Francis Bret Harte (1836 – 1902) –
            best remembered for his short fiction featuring miners, gamblers, and
            other romantic figures of the California Gold Rush.</p>

          FOCUS: BASIC 19TH CENTURY LITERARY TRENDS: REALISM AND NATURALISM
REALISM
Realism as a literary doctrine originated in France. It called for “reality and truth” in the depiction of ordinary life.
A reaction against Romanticism or a move away from romance and self-creating fictions;
A great interest in the realities of life, everyday existence, what was brutal or sordid and class struggle;
The background and training of the new authors was middle-class and journalistic rather than genteel and academic;
Influenced by Zola, Flaubert, Balzac, Dostoyevsky, and Tolstoy;
Insisted that the ordinary and the local were just as suitable for artistic portrayal as the magnificent and the remote.
REPRESENTATIVES:
William Dean Howells (1837-1920)
He defined the aims of realism as ‘nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material’. 
He was the champion of realism, and his novels carefully interweave social circumstances with the emotions of ordinary middleclass Americans.
In The Rise of Silas Lapham (1885), Howells best illustrated his aims, and his call up on writers to deal with the ordinary, average lives of American people.
Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), or Mark Twain
His stories and novels are famous for their humor, vivid details, and memorable characters. 
His best-known works are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
He examined American culture on the edge of the frontier and dealt seriously with such issues as slavery, poverty, and class differences.
In his sketches, articles, stories, and novels, he captured the flavor and spirit of America during the late nineteenth century.
Universal themes that affect people of all times. 
Samuel Clemens, better known by his pen name of Mark Twain, grew up in the Mississippi River frontier town of Hannibal, Missouri. 
 Early 19th-century American writers tended to be too flowery, sentimental, or ostentatious — partially because they were still trying to prove that they could write as elegantly as the English. Twain’s style, based on vigorous, realistic, colloquial American speech, gave American writers a new appreciation of their national voice. Twain was the first major author to come from the interior of the country, and he captured its distinctive, humorous slang and iconoclasm. For Twain and other American writers of the late 19th century, realism was not merely a literary technique: It was a way of speaking truth and exploding worn-out conventions. 
The most well-known example is Huck Finn, a poor boy who decides to follow the voice of his conscience and help a Negro slave escape to freedom, even though Huck thinks this means that he will be damned to hell for breaking the law. 
set in the Mississippi River village of St. Petersburg. The son of an alcoholic bum, Huck has just been adopted by a respectable family when his father, in a drunken stupor, threatens to kill him. Fearing for his life, Huck escapes, feigning his own death. He is joined in his escape by another outcast, the slave Jim, whose owner, Miss Watson, is thinking of selling him down the river to the harsher slavery of the deep South. Huck and Jim float on a raft down the majestic Mississippi, but are sunk by a steamboat, separated, and later reunited. They go through many comical and dangerous shore adventures that show the variety, generosity, and sometimes cruel irrationality of society. In the end, itis discovered that Miss Watson hadalready freed Jim, and a respectable family is taking care of the wild boy Huck. But Huck grows impatient with civilized society and plans to escape to “the territories” — Indian lands. The ending gives the reader the counter-version of the classic American success myth: the open road leading to the pristine wilderness, away from the morally corrupting influences of “civilization.”
Henry James (1843-1916)
Influenced by Ivan Turgenev – a novelist need to focus on the character rather than on the story;
Innovative and finely crafted prose;
Main subject: the inner, psychological workings of the individual mind and the moral problems facing America in the new age. 
Deals with the clash between the wise – yet corrupt – ways of the Old World, as represented by European civilization, and the innocence and vitality of the New one – America. 
In his earlier ‘international novels’ he explored the relationship and tensions underlying the relationships between Americans and Europeans.
MAJOR WORKS
The American (1877), The Portrait of a Lady (1881) The Wings of the Dove (1902) 
The Ambassadors (1903) The Golden Bowl (1904)
NATURALISM
Shortly before and after the turn of the twentieth century;
Influenced by Darwin’s theory and the 19th century French literature (Emile Zola);
Subjects from the lower ranks of the society
Portrayed misery and poverty of the underdogs who were victims of society and nature;
A major theme – human bestiality, especially as an explanation of sexual desire.

REPRESENTATIVES:
Stephen Crane (Red Badge of Courage, Maggie, A Girl of the Street…)
Frank Norris (McTeague…)
Theodore Dreiser (Sister Carrie, An American Tragedy…)
Jack London (The Call of the Wild; Martin Eden…)

REALISM VS NATURALISM
While being two separate literary movements, realism and naturalism have been at times used as interchangeable terms, sharing some deep-running similarities:
1) They are both "basic" views of life and humanity, stripping away the layers of romanticism to present a "natural" or "real" outlook of the work. They refuse to idealize or flatter the subject. They avoid artificial, fantasy, or supernatural elements.
2) Both of these pessimistic views emerged in the 19th century, a period known for its trials and turmoil.
3) God is absent from most of the writing in either category, with writers opting for a focus on the real world.
But despite these similarities, these two literary movements are separate for a reason.
1) Realism sought to be a faithful representation of life, while naturalism was more like a "chronicle of despair." In a way, naturalism proceeded from realism, and can be seen as an exaggerated form of realism; it shows humans as being determined by environment, heredity, and social conditions beyond their control, and thus rather helpless to escape their circumstances.
2) While in realism the main focus was on the middle class and its problems, naturalism often focused on poorly educated or lower-class characters, and on themes involving violence and taboo activities.
3) While in realism, faithful representation of reality including the details of nature is important, in Naturalism, nature itself is a force, generally a powerful, indifferent mechanism.
One might say that Naturalism is more limited kind of realism in which individual characters are not so much opened up and explored psychologically by the careful observation of their manners and moods and by the credible development of their circumstances, as they are buffeted and usually ruined by the greater forces of the world around them. Thus, the pure realist might write, “The wind blew in from the desert and dried the city air, stung the nostrils, caused the head to pound,” whereas the naturalist more likely would write, “The wind blew in from the desert, hot, sand-dry, malevolent; it scorched his soul and drove him near to madness.” Naturalism, almost despite its name, is saturated with the symbolic, whereas Realism is only lightly tinged with it.
Naturalists employ pop versions of evolutionary theory: humans retain animal qualities; God is absent, the natural forces (usually negative) prevail; chance and violence are omnipresent as causes. Cities and machines provide negative mass pressures.

        THE TURN OF THE CENTURY
FOCUS: HISTORICAL CONTEXT DEFINING THE BASIC LITARARY MOVEMENTS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY
WORLD WAR I 
When World War I broke out between the Allies  and the Central powers, Woodrow Wilson attempted to maintain American neutrality. Although American forces only arrived en masse towards the end of the war: the arrival of American troops in France made an important contribution to the Allied defeat of Germany. At home a spirit of patriotism prevailed. Famous movie stars promoted the bonds around the country and patriotic songs were composed in honor of the ‘doughboys’ fighting in far away Europe.
United States condemned itself to a period of isolationism in the field of international affairs for the next twenty years – until the outbreak of the Second World War once again led to cries for assistance.
POST-WAR AMERICAN SOCIETY
Post-war America witnessed continued growth in terms of population, and a continued movement away from rural areas to the ever increasing number of sprawling urban cities. This trend also brought about changes in the everyday lives of American people: city life was inevitably more hectic and impersonal, and family ties inevitably became weaker.
THE ROARING TWENTIES
The ‘Roaring Twenties’, as they fondly became known, brought with them radical changes in lifestyle. The nineteenth amendment to the Constitution (1920) had given women the right to vote, and, armed with their newly acquired independence, they quickly took advantage of the new opportunities opening up around them in the field of work. Some women (known as ‘Flappers’) rejected the more sober clothes of their predecessors in favor of shorter skirts and daring hairstyles. 
Flappers- young women in the 1920s who wore short skirts, listened to jazz music and showed their disdain for what was considered accepted behavior. They defined the modern look for the women (excessive make-up, drinking alcohol, smoking, driving cars…). Viewed by many at the time as outrageous, immoral or downright dangerous, they are now considered the first generation of independent American women.
The eighteenth ‘Prohibition’ amendment (1920) had attempted to outlaw sales of liquor, but ‘speak-easies’ (or secret nightclubs) ensured that ‘bootleg’ (illegally procured) alcohol was available in generous quantities to an ever thirsty public. 
Gangs of thugs seeking control of the illegal alcohol market proliferated in the larger cities and the levels of crime and violence rose considerably.
A series of Republican administrations under Harding (1921-1923), Coolidge (1923-1929) and Hoover (1929 - 1933) attempted to curb the newly unleashed forces of hedonism in an attempt to restore older and more traditional social values. The efforts of federal government to curb contemporary excesses found sympathetic support in other sections of society. Religious revivalism became increasingly popular in both rural and urban areas, and after a period of relative anonymity the Ku Klux Klan returned to its former strengths. It took blacks, Jews, Catholics and political radicals as its scapegoats for society’s ills.
THE WALL STREET CRASH
Not everyone benefited from the economic prosperity of the 1920s: while manufacturers and large companies continued to expand. Little was done to help either American farmers or laborers, however, and their resulting poverty inevitably led to a reduction in domestic demand. Very soon America was producing more than it could actually consume. Confident of high returns on their investments in the stock market, increasing numbers of Americans bought stocks during the 1920s, but towards the end of the decade wild bouts of speculation pushed the value of these investments to artificially high levels. In October 1929 prices started to decline and the resulting panic led to the great stock market crash in which it has been estimated American investors lost over $50 billion. The Great Depression which followed lasted for a full ten years.

THE GREAT DEPRESSION
The failure of the banking system during the crash of ’29 meant that hundreds of thousands of people lost their life savings overnight. 
THE NEW DEAL
In 1932 the Democrat F. D. Roosevelt replaced Hoover as President of the United States. His program for recovery was called the New Deal, and it involved greater government intervention in the affairs of the economy than had ever been seen before. ‘The only thing we have to fear,’ said Roosevelt, ‘is fear itself’, and he quickly set about the total reorganization of the economy.
Loans were made to industry in order to stimulate growth and fight unemployment; banks were made subject to a series of stricter regulations and stock market activities were more carefully controlled; a program of public works projects created new jobs and farmers were provided with relief schemes; the newly created Social Security Board helped elaborate a system of social security. By the end of the decade these measures were beginning to have positive effects, and such was Roosevelt’s popularity that he was re-elected four times. A much needed boost to the economy in the form of military spending was provided by the Second World War – the next serious challenge to America’s development as a world power.

          THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY LITERARY CONTEXT
FOCUS: LITTLE MAGAZINES. MODERNISM IN POETRY. IMAGISM. EZRA POUND; T. S. ELIOT; ROBERT FROST; WALLACE STEVENS; E. E. CUMMINGS.
The inter-war period in American literary history was characterized by experimentation and creative inventiveness as writers – especially in the field of poetry – attempted to come to terms with new philosophical and psychological interpretations of reality. The discovery of the subconscious and new concepts regarding time meant that the scope of literary reference was broadened and orthodox beliefs of the past were laid open to question.
Aesthetic consideration were formalized anew as American literary criticism matured: Ezra Pound, leading literary critic of the time, was joined by T.S. Eliot and Wallace Stevens in his analysis of the writer’s craft, and further important contributions were made by Earnest Hemingway and the influential Gertrude Stein. 
LITTLE MAGAZINES
Writers measured themselves according to new literary canons as ‘literary criticism’ developed into a serious and systematic genre. Conventional standards and established authors were questioned and attacked by a new body of writers whose works were frequently published by the so called ‘little magazines’ – independent-minded periodicals more concerned with publishing new authors and establishing new critical standards than the material rewards of commercial success. 
MODERNISM
Experimentation and creative inventiveness;
New ideas;
Breaking with tradition;
Fragmentation;
Experimentation with point of view;
American literary criticism matured.
AMERICAN MODERNIST POETS
Ezra Pound (1885–1972)
A controversial figure;
Technical innovations and use of unconventional poetic materials which often baffled readers;
No determinant identity or poetic voice;
A multiplicity of identities and voices;
A fierce individualist.
IMAGISM
An anti-Romantic movement in poetry; 
Simple and few words;
The image is let to speak of itself;
Derived its technique from classical Chinese and Japanese poetry—stressing clarity, precision, and economy of language; 
Everyday speech, new rhythms, and clear, sharp images;
Key representatives of Imagism: Ezra Pound, Hilda Doolittle (H. D.) and Amy Lowell.
Pound's rules for writing Imagist poems:
1. Direct treatment of the "thing," whether subjective or objective.
2. To use absolutely no word that did not contribute to the presentation.
3. As regarding rhythm: to compose in sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome.
In a Station of the Metro
The apparition of these faces in the crowd;
Petals on a wet, black bough.
                                                        (Ezra Pound)
SOME HELPFUL HINTS TO ANALYZE THE POEM:
1. Think about the function of the title of the poem.
2. Pay attention to the images and the way they are introduced in the poem in terms of syntax.
3. Is he comparing? Is he seeing both things?
4. Does this approach remind you of any poetic tradition?

T. S. Eliot (1888-1965)
- Came under the influence of Ezra Pound;
 - The Waste Land (1922) - considered to be the most influential poetic work of the 20th century; 
- His poems articulated the disillusionment of a younger post–World War I generation with the values and conventions of the Victorian era.
Robert Frost (1874-1963)

At the crossroads of 19th-century American poetry and modernism;
His poetry is resolutely American;
An original, modern idiom and a sense of directness and economy that reflect the imagism of Ezra Pound  and Amy Lowell;
On the other hand - no marked departure from the poetic practices of the 19th century;
Avoids traditional verse forms, but his technique is never experimental and he is not an innovator.
The Rose Family
(Robert Frost)
The rose is a rose,
And was always a rose.
But the theory now goes
That the apple's a rose,
And the pear is, and so's
The plum, I suppose.
The dear only knows
What will next prove a rose.
You, of course, are a rose -
But were always a rose.
SOME HELPFUL HINTS TO ANALYZE THE POEM:
1. Think about the symbolism behind the rose.
2. What might be the aim of this cliché?
3. What feeling does the constant repetition evoke in you?
Wallace Stevens (1879-1955)
Focused his attention on man and the things in his world; 
A master stylist, employing an extraordinary vocabulary and a rigorous precision in crafting his poems. 
A philosopher of aesthetics, vigorously exploring the notion of poetry as the supreme fusion of the creative imagination and objective reality. 
E. E. Cummings (1894–1962)
- One of the most innovative poets of his time; 
- Experimented with poetic form and language to create a distinct personal style; 
- Disregarded grammar and punctuation; 
- Always used “i” instead of “I” as a protest against self-importance;

        <p>16. THE LOST GENERATION FOCUS: Ernest Hemingway; Francis
            Scott Key Fitzgerald World War I was followed by a period of spiritual
            crisis characterized by: the feeling of gloom and despair; modern warfare
            was not glorious or heroic; a sense of doom, dislocation and
            fragmentation; a sense of loss: a loss of faith and of inherited, pre-war
            values, which no longer seemed relevant; pre-war ideals of patriotism,
            faith and morality were questioned; writers felt the old norms were no
            longer relevant. LOST GENERATION - in general, the post-World War I
            generation, but specifically a group of U.S. writers who established their
            literary reputations in the 1920s: Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald,
            John Dos Passos, E. E. Cummings, Archibald MacLeish, Hart Crane, T. S.
            Eliot and many other writers who made Paris the center of their literary
            activities in the 1920s. They were never a literary school and in the
            1930s they turned in different directions. Spiritual alienation from a
            U.S. that seemed to be hopelessly provincial, materialistic, and
            emotionally barren. The term was coined by Gertrude Stein - an American
            novelist, poet, playwright, and art collector, who once said to Hemingway:
            “All of you young people who served in the war. You are a lost
            generation... You have no respect for anything. You drink yourselves to
            death.” Gertrude Stein CHARACTERISTICS: Expatriates who lived in Paris;
            Sought the meaning of life; Youthful idealism;  Excessive drinking;
            Excessive behavior; Frequent love affairs;  Rejected modern American
            materialism; Produced some of the finest literary masterpieces. COMMON
            THEMES: The authors’ experiences in World War I and their life after it;
            The lifestyle and the low moral of the wealthy (The Sun Also Rises; The
            Great Gatsby); The death of the American dream (The Great Gatsby). Ernest
            Hemingway (1899–1961) SOME BIOGRAPHICAL FACTS In high school - worked on
            his school newspaper, Trapeze and Tabula, writing primarily about sports;
            Immediately after graduation - went to work for the Kansas City Star;
            1918: went overseas to serve in World War I as an ambulance driver in the
            Italian Army; At the age of 20 - returned to the United States; Spent time
            in northern Michigan before taking a job at the Toronto Star; Met his
            first wife (Hadley Richardson) and they moved to Paris; In Paris,
            Hemingway soon became a key part of what Gertrude Stein would famously
            call the Lost Generation; Hemingway made the acquaintance of many great
            writers and artists of his generation: F. S. Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, Pablo
            Picasso and James Joyce; 1928: settled in Key West, Florida; The 1930s:
            writing and chasing adventure - big-game hunting in Africa, bullfighting
            in Spain, deep-sea fishing in Florida; When the United States entered
            World War II, Hemingway served as a correspondent; By this time the writer
            had also begun frequenting the famous Festival of San Fermin in Pamplona,
            Spain. AWARDS Silver Medal of Military Valor, Italian Armed Forces (WWI)
            Bronze Star, United States Armed Forces (1947) Pulitzer Prize (1953)
            American Academy of Arts and Letters Award of Merit (1954) Nobel Prize for
            Literature (1954) BASIC WORKS: The Sun Also Rises (1926)  A Farewell to
            Arms (1929)  For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940)  The Old Man and the Sea
            (1952)  A Moveable Feast (1964)  And many more books, non-fiction, letters
            and short stories. HEMINGWAY’S WRITING STYLE The tip of the iceberg;
            Simple, direct, and unadorned style, probably a result of his early
            newspaper training; Avoids the adjective whenever possible; A master of
            dialogue. Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (1896 – 1940) SOME BIOGRAPHICAL
            FACTS Studied in Princeton and wrote scripts for musicals, articles and
            stories; Dropped out of school in 1917 to join the U.S. Army; Afraid that
            he might die in World War I with his literary dreams unfulfilled, he
            hastily wrote a novel called The Romantic Egotist.  Fitzgerald was
            assigned to Camp Sheridan, Alabama where he met and fell in love with
            18-year-old Zelda Sayre, the daughter of an Alabama Supreme Court judge.
            Upon his discharge he moved to New York City hoping to launch a career in
            advertising lucrative enough to convince Zelda to marry him. However, he
            quit his job after only a few months and returned to St. Paul to rewrite
            his novel. WORKS This Side of Paradise (1920)  A largely autobiographical
            story about love and greed; The novel turned Fitzgerald into one of the
            country's most promising young writers; One week after the novel's
            publication, he married Zelda Sayre in New York. The Beautiful and Damned
            (1922) The story of the troubled marriage of Anthony and Gloria Patch; 
            Confirmed Fitzgerald’s status as one of the great chroniclers and
            satirists of the Jazz Age – a culture of wealth, extravagance and
            ambition. “It was an age of miracles, it was an age of art, it was an age
            of excess, and it was an age of satire." The Great Gatsby (1925) Narrated
            by Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner who moves next door to a mansion owned by
            the wealthy and mysterious Jay Gatsby. The novel follows Gatsby's pursuit
            of a married woman ultimately leading to his exposure as a bootlegger and
            his death. Perhaps the quintessential American novel; Beautiful lyricism,
            perfect portrayal of the Jazz Age, a critique of materialism, and the
            American Dream. Tender is the Night (1934); The darkest and most
            autobiographical of Fitzgerald's novels; It focuses on Dick and Nicole
            Diver's crumbling marriage. A story of estrangement and infidelity;
            Explores how love can be won, lost, and perverted by different forces like
            money, illness, and politics. PERSONAL ISSUES Always a heavy drinker, he
            progressed steadily into alcoholism; Suffered prolonged periods of
            writer's block; Zelda suffered from mental health issues; The couple spent
            the late 1920s moving back and forth between Delaware and France. 1937:
            Fitzgerald attempted to revive his career as a screenwriter and freelance
            storywriter in Hollywood; 1939: began work on another novel, The Love of
            the Last Tycoon, but he died of a heart attack before finishing it.

        <p>1940-PRESENT HISTORICAL CONTEXT PARTICIPATION IN WW2 Following the
            Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, America joined the Allies in
            their fight against Italy, German and Japan. Their contribution was to
            prove decisive: 15 million men joined the armed forces, many of whom were
            deployed in Europe, and the Allied war effort was much strengthened. In
            1945, President Truman gave orders to drop the atomic bomb on Nagasaki and
            Hiroshima, and thus brought to an abrupt end the Second World War. BEFORE
            THE EXPLOSION THE EXPLOSION AFTER THE EXPLOSION THE COLD WAR Despite being
            allies throughout the war, Russia and the Americans were to embark on a
            new kind of war after 1945: the so-called Cold War lasted up until very
            recent times and was characterized by American attempts to contain the
            advancing threat of communism throughout the world. America provided
            countries threatened with communism with both financial and military aid
            up until the official collapse of the Eastern Bloc in the late 80s. Both
            the wars in Korea (1950-53) and Vietnam (1957-75) saw American troops
            deployed in an effort to crush the communist threat in these two
            countries. If the Korean War ended in a truce between pro and
            anti-communist forces, the war in Vietnam proved a costly enterprise in
            terms of both human lives lost and national morale. Indeed, President
            Nixon’s decision to withdraw ground troops from Vietnam in 1973 was a
            formal recognition of defeat at hands of the better organized Northern
            Vietnamese Communist troops. The Americans looked many years to recover
            from the effects of this war. Nixon’s visits to China and the USSR in 1972
            gave room for hope that diplomatic relations between Communist and Western
            Bloc countries would improve and despite the continued growth of ever more
            sophisticated nuclear arms on both sides, and the implicit threat of
            nuclear war, relations between East and West slowly improved. Ronal
            Reagan’s presidency (1980-88) was influential in reducing nuclear arms on
            both sides and the collapse of the Berlin Wall on 1989 further accelerated
            the end of the Cold War. HOME AFFAIRS. THE AMERICAN SOCIETY. Increasing
            material wealth but continued division between rich and poor; Despite
            inflation and recession the American economy prospered after WW2; An
            ever-growing number of consumers (the population rose by 28 million
            between 1950 and 1960) provided a ready market for the wealth of goods
            available – cars, televisions, dishwashers, etc.; A general move from the
            cities to the suburbs during the post war period and the automobile became
            an indispensable aspect of modern American life; Not everybody shared in
            the growing prosperity: large minority groups of blacks and Hispanic
            Americans lived in the poverty stricken areas of urban America; In the
            1950s - a chorus of organized protests; This was to culminate in the Civil
            Rights movement of the 1960s: Martin Luther King (assassinated in 1968)
            and Malcolm X became the active voices of Black American protest, and,
            although measures were taken to improve the lot of blacks in America
            during the 1960s, minority groups continued to be discriminated against
            through the 1970s and 1980s. The gap between rich and poor became
            increasingly evident during the Reagan administration. LITERARY CONTEXT
            After the Second World War American literature continued to flourish but
            not in any one distinct direction: it would be difficult to say what its
            mainstream works are. Instead, other sections of the variegated patchwork
            that is American society began to produce important writings including
            Jews, African-Americans, Native-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans,
            homosexuals and so on. Many of these groups came to the fore during the
            1960s and 1970s. Perhaps the only theme that links together these various
            groups is their interest in America’s theme par excellence: individuality.
            THE BEAT GENERATION Included prose writers and poets centered in San
            Francisco and NYC in the 1940s and 1950s; BEAT = ‘beaten down’ or
            ‘beatific’; Celebrated freedom and stood against middle-class values,
            commercialism and conformity; Enthusiasm for the visionary states produced
            by religious meditation, sexual experience, jazz, or drugs; Drew their
            inspiration from quintessential American artists (Walt Whitman) and the
            jazz composer and musician Charlie Parker, as well as from Zen Buddhism.
            MAIN REPRESENTATIVES: Jack Kerouac (1922 – 1969) - On the Road; Allen
            Ginsberg (1926 - 1997) – Howl (the manifesto of the Beat Movement);
            William S. Burroughs (1914–1997) - Junky and Naked Lunch; Lawrence
            Ferlinghetti, Gregory Corso, Gary Snyder - poets who also took Walt
            Whitman as their spiritual and literary father. "Holy Peter holy Allen holy Solomon
            holy Lucien holy Kerouac holy Huncke holy Burroughs holy Cassady holy the
            unknown buggered and suffering beggars holy the hideous human angels! […]
            (Footnote to Howl by Allen Ginsberg) It is obvious that the extract above
            sounds quite different in tone. Poetic inspiration is no longer found in
            an archive. Poetry is that holy, lived experience, the ecstatic. A new use
            of language – mirroring the speed of experience. You might have felt
            embarrassed while reading it! Embarrassment is something that the beats
            wanted and valued. Jack Kerouac (1922 – 1969) A novelist recognized for
            his method of spontaneous prose; On the Road (1957) – a
            semiautobiographical novel, which documents pretty closely the actual road
            trips that Kerouac took with his friends; Language – aiming to reproduce
            experience; A new kind of language – elimination of small words (the, and
            …); syntax can be set aside; language needs to move at the speed of
            experience and at the speed of ecstasy. Language – imitating experience.
            PROSE Flourishing American literature but not a distinct direction of it;
            Different sections of the American society started to produce important
            writings; Jewish novelists – continued to some degree the Yiddish
            tradition and blended it into American writing (Saul Bellow, Bernard
            Malamud, Philip Roth); African-American writers – Tony Morrison wrote
            about the black experience in America from the times of slavery to this
            day; her writing is highly poetic but never ignores the horrors and
            tragedies of life; AMERICAN POST WW2 FICTION - Norman Mailer - The Naked
            and the Dead (1948) - James Jones - From Here to Eternity (1951 SATIRE AND
            DARK HUMOR J. D. Salinger (1919- 2010) - The Catcher in the Rye (1951) – a
            classical portrayal of rebellious youth; Joseph Heller (1923 – 1999)
            –Catch-22 (1961) – a humorous madness about the madness of war. COMPLEX
            PLOTS Thomas Pynchon (1937 -) – V (1963) Kurt Vonnegut (1922 – 2007) -
            Slaughterhouse-Five (1969 Both authors shared the same belief that human
            beings are trapped in a meaningless world and neither God nor man can make
            sense of the human condition. Vladimir Nabokov (1899 – 1977) A
            Russian-born American novelist and critic; Wrote both in Russian and
            English; Refined prose and complex literary structures; Being an outsider
            made him particularly aware of the manias of modern America; Lolita (1955)
            – the satirical tale of a college professor who falls in love with a young
            girl. POETRY CONFESSIONAL POETS Robert Lowell, Randall Jarrell, John
            Berryman, Theodore Roethke, … - impersonal, hard-edged poetry for intense
            personal confessions, often presented in finely crafted poems in
            traditional forms; Sylvia Plath used this confessional style to give a
            poetic portrayal of her psychological breakdown. OTHER GROUPS BLACK POETS
            – inspired by the Beats; (Gwendolyn Brooks, Amiri Baraka); NATIVE
            AMERICANS – towards the end of the last century large numbers of Native
            American poets begin to write in English; CHICANO (MEXICAN-AMERICAN)
            poetry: Rudolfo Anaya, Cherrie Moraga and Gary Soto. They write in both
            Spanish and English, often blending poetry and prose. DRAMA Eugene O’Neill
            (1888 – 1953) Introduced psychological and social realism to the American
            stage; (techniques earlier associated with Russian playwright Anton
            Chekhov and Henrik Ibsen); The first to include speeches in American
            vernacular and involve characters on the fringes of society; Experimental
            and emotionally probing dramas; deep psychological complexity. Arthur
            Miller (1915 – 2005) Death of a Salesman (1949) – a modern tragedy that
            tells of the life and death of a travelling salesman; The Crucible (1953)
            – Miller wrote indirectly about the hunt of communists of Senator Joseph
            McCarthy during the 1950s. The play deals with the witch trials held in
            Salem, Massachusetts. Tennessee Williams (1911 – 1983) Wrote moving and
            poetic plays about outsiders. A Streetcar Named Desire (1947) – tells the
            story of a woman whose illusions of being Southern gentlewoman are
            shattered by her tough, working-class husband. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof
