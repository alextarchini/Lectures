            <p>Motivation to study English &ndash;</p>
           
           <p>The case of expatriates in Brussels</p>
           
                     
           <p>Abstract</p>
           
           <p>The objective of this thesis is to understand the motivational factors driving expatriates in Brussels to learn English as a second language. Brussels is a very cosmopolitan city where 179 different nationalities live and use English as lingua franca to communicate among each other. There is not much research in literature on second language learning motivation on expatriates, and the publications available in literature focus on the motivation to learn the language of the host country rather than global English.</p>
           
           <p>This study employs Taguchi&rsquo;s (2009) questionnaire as quantitative method to understand what motivational factors are most related to the intended effort to study English (which is a measure of motivation) in the context of Dornyei&rsquo;s L2 self motivation theory. The sample used in the study consists of 40 expatriates learning English in Brussels.</p>
           
           <p>The main outcome of the study is that the &lsquo;Attitudes towards learning English&rsquo; and &lsquo;Incentive values&rsquo; (a variable including instrumental motives and travel orientation) are the factors most closely related to the intended effort, whereas the Ideal L2 self and Ought-to L2 self did not directly correlate with the intended effort.</p>
           
                   
           <p>I. Introduction</p>
           
           <p>1.1 Origins of the study</p>
           
           <p>Growing up as a Roma girl in the segregated Roma district of the town of Razlog in the south western region of Bulgaria, I was not encouraged by my teachers to invest effort in my education, and in fact often discouraged, as teachers did not really like to have Roma pupils in their classrooms. Later, in my life, when I started my secondary school education, I began to learn English. I really fell in love with the language and that was primarily because of my English teacher&rsquo;s attitude. She never discriminated me for being a Roma and always showed a very different attitude compared with the other teachers, always inspiring and encouraging, which really motivated me to put effort in learning the language. Some of my motivation to study English was also related to the prospect of finding new and exciting study and work opportunities abroad. Since then, the topic of motivation to study, and specifically motivation to learn English, has always been very close to my heart. I started to be more and more intrigued about what the current theories say about the main drivers of language learning motivation and psychological structures related to it, not only to try to see if my main personal motives to learn English were reflected in the theories, but also to understand and learn how one day I could become an inspiring and motivating teacher to my future students. Therefore, I have chosen to carry out this research work on English language learning motivation and I chose expatriates living and studying English in Brussels as a target group. There is not much literature addressing this group profile and I therefore hope I can contribute with my study to bringing something new to the research on English language learning motivation.</p>
           
           <p>1.2 Organisation of the thesis</p>
           
           <p>In the next chapter of the thesis, the objective of the study is explained in detail and arguments are provided about how it differs from previous literature on expatriates&rsquo; language learning motivation. The third chapter of the thesis consists of a review of the most important theories of second language learning motivation, that is Gardner&rsquo;s socio-educational model, Deci and Ryan&rsquo;s self determination theory and how Noels applied it to second language learning motivation, Higgin&rsquo;s self discrepancy theory and Dornyei&rsquo;s L2 motivation system. At the end of this chapter, the latest developments on L2 motivation theories and a dedicated review on the concept of Ideal Multilingual Self are presented. In Chapter 4, the specific research question addressed in this study is formulated and the details on the methodology and the questionnaire used as instrument are exposed. Chapter 5 deals with the findings of the study and it covers the data analysis, more specifically: reliability analysis, mean score analysis and correlation analysis. The final chapter of the thesis presents the conclusions and gives perspective on how the results of this work could be applied to positively influence English language learning motivation for the student group subject of this research.</p>
