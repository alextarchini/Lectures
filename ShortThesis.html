          <p>1. Hi, my name is Alex Tarchini and this is the research that I did on motivation to study English, with the case in point being expats in an international city like Brussels</p>

<p>2. Let&#39;s start with a bit of a background on this research:</p>

<p>study motivation has always been close to my heart because of my own experience as a student and because of the prospects of finding better opportunities abroad</p>

<p>The objective of this study is to find out what motviates BXL expats to learn EN</p>

<p>And here comes to the question of why this study &ndash; well, there is not much lit on expats (lang of the host country only, not EN as an intl lang)</p>

<p>in summary main outcomes are: that Attitudes to learning EN &amp; incentive values (instrumental motives and travel orientation) are the strongest factors, whereas Ideal L2 and Ought-to self did not directly correlate.</p>

<p>3. Now, let&#39;s talk about the organisation:</p>

<p>1. ch 1 is does intro and overview</p>

<p>2. ch 2 gives the context of the study</p>

<p>3. ch 3 presents the Lit Review on the theories in the field</p>

<p>starting with Gardner&#39;s socio-educational model of L2 learning</p>

<p>Self-determination Theory (Ryan and Deci) and how Noels applied in the context of lang learning motivation</p>

<p>Higgin&#39;s self-descrepancy theory</p>

<p>subchapter 4 does an overview of Dornyei&#39;s L2 self motivation system</p>

<p>while subchapters 5 and 6discuss the latest developments in the field and the Ideal multilingual self</p>

<p>4. chapter 4 presents the research question and the methodology</p>

<p>5. chapter 5 discusses the results</p>

<p>6. and chapter 6 exposes the conclusions and gives some pedagogical applications</p>

<p>4. These are the main theories in the field of motivation studies: Gardner, Noels, Higgins, Dornyeis. And for this work I have used Dornyei&#39;s L2 motivation system as conceptual framework &ndash; This theory has been tested extensively, and the the questionaire for it has been used both in large and small case studies. (Taguchi and Markova). And on top of it, it is the most promiment theory in recent years..</p>

<p>5. As the for the research question, it is stated exactly as &ldquo;What are the L2 motivational characteritics of intl expats in Brussels who study EN as a 2nd lang&rdquo;.</p>

<p>1. As for the methodology:</p>

<p>the smaple size consisted of 40 foreign BXL exptats studying at the St Josse Language centre, age 20 to 58 (the majority were in the age group of 20-40), the respondents were from 3 different continents &ndash; Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Data collection took place May-June 2021 via a link to Google Forms.</p>

<p>The instruments used was Taguchi&#39;s 2009 qiestionnaire and these are the variables.</p>

<p>6. Now, I will give you a very brief overview of the results:</p>

<p>1. the 1st graph shows the participants&#39; coutnries of origin.</p>

<p>2. When it comes to the reliability anaylis, I used the Cronbach alpha as a measure for internal consistency of the scale (The rule is if Cronbach&#39;s alpha (b/n 0 and 1 &ndash; the questions used might not tap in the same entity) is less than 0.6 it means that the internal consitency of that variable). The vars that had to be excluded were &ldquo;Integrativeness&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;ATTITUDE TWDS L2 COMMUNITY&rdquo;. INTEGRATIVENESS&rdquo;. The reason: Most likely it is because in BXL it is not easy to identify clearly the L2 EN speaking community.</p>

<p>7. Mean score analysis:</p>

<p>1. IN the meanscore analysis &ndash; the ideal L2 self and the vars related to it scored higher (instrumentality promo, ), while the ought-to and its vars scored lower (parental encouragement, instrumentality prevention), And this is consistent with other research done in the past. Separate &ndash; attitude twnds learnign EN &ndash; learning situation. - separate.</p>

<p>2. We see some similarities with previous studies &ndash; the vars related to ideal self got higher cored, 2. ethnocentrism and EN amxiety score low, but the mean value does not tell us much about how the different vars are related to the intended effort. Because of this I proceeded with the correlation analysis.</p>

<p>3. This is the correlation matrix and I identified the correlation coefficients at both 99 and 95% confidence (similar approach in Lit). Above 0.32 &ndash; 95%, above 0.4 it&#39;s 99% confidence. The treshhold for a sample of 40.</p>

<p>4. To interprete it I have created this summary</p>

<p>1. I started 1st with the vars that at at 99% Confidence (2 stars) &ndash; 1. ATTITUDES TWD EN, INSTRUMETNALITY PROMO, &amp; TRAVEL ORIENTATION.</p>

<p>2. To move on, I put down the vars that are correlated at 99% confidence with those 3, but still at 95% confidence with intended effort.</p>

<p>1. ATTIDES TWD EN &ndash; the only with 2 stars in 0.73, which was already discussed</p>

<p>2. Instrumentality promo - Only 2 stars are: 0.44 (discussed), 0.40 &ndash; but with Ought to (which is not correlated with the criteorion measure (0.29, and treshhold is 0.3 &ndash; it had not star).</p>

<p>1. Instumentality prevention (to be accepted, it needs at least 1 star with criterion measure) &ndash; Yes (0.39)</p>

<p>2. travel &ndash; 0.51. - already in diagram</p>

<p>3. TRAVEL:</p>

<p>1. fear of assimilation &ndash; exlcuded, because it has only 1 star</p>

<p>2. INSTRUMENTALITY PREVENTION -</p>

<p>3.</p>

<p>4. To try to visualise in a simpler way the correlations, I made this graph -</p>

<p>In this graph I am and I amalso showing the correlations with the inteded effort only at 99% confience.</p>

<p>In this graph I am reporting the vars that are correlated with the VAR INTENDED EFFORT at 95% confidence at least.</p>

<p>And then I have reported the correlations among these vars (which are represented by the blue double edged arrows), and all these correlations are at 99% confidence.</p>

<p>From this diagram it is easy to see that INSTUMENTALITY PROMO, PREVENTION and TRAVEL are intercorrelated among the each other and with similar correlation coefficients. So from this study it is hard to try to separate the effect of these vars, and that&#39;s why I have included these 3 vars into 1 entity called INCENTIVE VALUES. And this led me to the conclusion that attitudes twd learning situation and incentive values are the 2 vars most related with the entended effort.</p>

<p>8. The conclusion is that the strongest var is ATTITUDES TWD LEARNING EN, so my recommendation would be to make sure the whole EN learning experience is enjoyable, and provide lots of opps to network and socialise.</p>

<p>1. The 2nd strongest var is INCENTIVE VALUES &ndash; in this case my recommendation is to leverage the value students place on EN as means to expand their work, study, travel opps (e.g. By sharing success stories.</p>

            <p>I. Introduction</p>

            <p>1.1 Origins of the study:</p>
            
            <p>the topic of motivation to study, and specifically motivation to learn English, has always been very close to my heart. Growing up as a Roma girl I was not much encouraged by my teachers to invest effort in my education, and in fact was often discouraged. It was not the case with learning English - I fell in love with the language and that was primarily because of my English teacher&rsquo;s attitude. Some of my motivation was also in the prospect of finding new and exciting study and work opportunities abroad.</p>
            
            <p>With this research I tried to see if my main personal motives to learn English were reflected in the theories, but also to understand and learn how one day I could become an inspiring and motivating teacher. I chose to do this research focusing on expatriates living and studying English in Brussels as a target group. There is not much literature addressing this group profile, so I hope I can contribute with my study to bringing something new to the research on English language learning motivation.</p>
            
            <p>1.2 Organisation:</p>
            
            <p>Chapter 1 presents the objective of the study, while chapter 2 explains provids arguments of how it differs from previous studies. The 3d chapter does a literature review of the most important theories of second language learning motivation (Gardner&rsquo;s socio-educational model, Deci and Ryan&rsquo;s self determination theory and how Noels applied it to second language learning motivation, Higgin&rsquo;s self discrepancy theory and Dornyei&rsquo;s L2 motivation system + latest developments in L2 motivation theories and Ideal Multilingual Self). Chapter 4 outlines the research question and the methodology. Chapter 5 disusses the results of the study and covers covers the data analysis (reliability, mean score and correlation analysis). Chapter 6 presents the conclusions and gives perspective on how the results could be applied to positively influence English language learning motivation.</p>

            <p>II. Research Context</p>

            <p>2.1 Background</p>
            
            <p>This study tries to provide a snapshot of the factors that motivate foreign language students to learn English, with expatriates in an international city such as Brussels as a case in point. The objective of the present research project is to report on the findings of a survey covering a sample of 40 expatriates studying English and to analyse their motivation.</p>
            
            <p>2.2 Problem definition - why is motivation important?</p>
            
            <p>Motivation is the 2nd -best predictor of learners achievement scores, [the first being language aptitude]&rdquo;. However, while &ldquo;language aptitude is a matter of innate endowment and relatively fixed, motivation is more subject to change&rdquo;. This study focuses on the factors that motivate expatriates in Brussels to learn English. This study involves a sample limited to 40 expatriates, so may not be generalisable to different groups of expatriates.</p>
            
            <p>Expats (living in a country that is not their own) vs immigrants (live permanently in a different country). The difference is that immigrants have decided to move to a different country from their own permanently, whereas the permanent nature of the sojourn abroad is not specified and the move abroad could be temporary with expats.</p>
            
            <p>Why Brussels: I live in BXL. It&#39;s a cosmopolitan city with a significantly large community of expatriates from all over the world (70% people of foreign origin - thanks to the many international institutions that have headquarters). This makes Brussels an obvious place where to conduct studies on expatriates. In addition to the two official languages, &ldquo;English is the most important school language&rdquo; and &ldquo;is frequently used in an economic and cultural context&rdquo;. As such, a sufficient level of English is required to connect and integrate in the international community living in the city and with other expatriates. So, expats may need to attend English courses to improve their English to integrate in the international community. Moreover, given the usually temporary nature of their stay abroad, expats may value global English more than the host country official languages, as global English could still be useful once their sojourn in Brussels ends and they are ready to move on to a different country.</p>
            
            <p>There are very few publications in literature that study L2 motivation among expatriates, yet there has been a growing number of expatriates and mobile students in the past years. The publications available in literature having expatriates as target group focus on the motivation to learn the language of the host country (DK, CN). Other studied focus on expatriates&rsquo; motivation to learn the language of the host country and none of them focuses on English. The objective of my research is to study expatriates&rsquo; motivation to learn English as international language rather than the language of the host country. This has not been tackled in previous publications and could provide new insights on expatriates&rsquo; motivation to learn a second language. Given the multicultural nature of Brussels, there is no dominant language group that could be associated to the host country language. Therefore, Brussels is particularly suitable to conduct a research on motivation to learn English as international language.</p>

            <p>III. Theoretical Overview</p>

<p>The study of foreign language motivation has been attracting a lot of interest throughout the years. This chapter presents the main theories explaining motivation, namely: Gardner&rsquo;s socio-educational model, Noels&rsquo; model based on Deci and Ryan&rsquo;s self-determination theory, Higgins&rsquo; self discrepancy theory, Dornyei&#39;s Second Language (L2) motivation self-system and the latest theoretical developments originating from it + Ideal Multilingual Self.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2nd language - a language which is readily available or has political importance.</p>

<p>Foreign language - not readily available or lacks political importance. I use &ldquo;second language&rdquo; for English in Brussels, as English is extensively present and used in economic and cultural contexts in the Belgian capital.</p>

<p>3.1 Gardner&rsquo;s socio-educational model of second language learning</p>

<p>Gardner&rsquo;s socio-educational model establishes what factors determine motivation. These are: attitudes towards the learning situation, integrativeness and instrumentality. Attitudes towards the learning situation &ldquo;includes all variables that can be linked directly to the educational system and the experiences associated with the educational environment.&rdquo;. Integrativeness refers to the &ldquo;individual being interested in learning the language in order to interact with valued members of the other community and/or to learn more about that community&rdquo;. Instrumentality refers to the desire to be able to work and advance in the career thanks to the acquired language skills. According to Gardner, attitudes towards the learning situation and integrativeness are better predictors of motivation than instrumentality.</p>

<p>The AMTB (Attitude/Motivation Test Battery) is the instrument used by Gardner to measure all the conceptual components of the socio-educational model (Vars: Attitudes towards the learning situation, integrativeness, instrumentality, motivation, and anxiety). All ware positively correlated with the language achievement. Although integrativeness and attitudes towards the learning situation do impact the achievements in learning a second language, they act through motivation. Integratively motivated students are in a better position to learn foreign languages.</p>

<p>2 other types of motivation within the integrative motivation &ndash; integrative and assimilative. The assimilative motivation drives students to acquire language to such a level that they would speak the language as a native speaker.</p>

<p>The major criticism was that Gardner&#39;s model was based on second language learning in bilingual countries, and as such its applicability in broader contexts would be limited - e.g. foreign language learning.</p>

<p>3.2 Self-Determination Theory</p>

<p>Noels&#39;s theory is based on Deci and Ryan&rsquo;s self-determination theory. There are 2 general types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation is based on the interest in learning the language and on the positive emotions and sensations deriving from the language learning process. Extrinsic motivation is based on external factors (instrumental end, e.g. earning a reward or avoiding a punishment).</p>

<p>Noels et al. (2003) define three types of intrinsic motivation (IM): IM-knowledge - &ldquo;the motivation for doing an activity for the feelings associated with exploring new ideas and developing knowledge&rdquo; (p. 38), IM-accomplishment - &ldquo;the sensations related to attempting to master a task or achieve a goal&rdquo; (p. 38), and IM-stimulation - &ldquo;motivation based simply on the sensations stimulated by performing the task, such as aesthetic appreciation or fun and excitement.&rdquo; (p. 38). Furthermore, Noels&#39; model also distinguishes three types of extrinsic motivation (Noels et al., 2003): EM-external regulation - &ldquo;activities that are determined by sources external to the person&rdquo; (p. 39), EM-introjected regulation &ldquo;reasons that pertain to performing an activity due to some type of pressure that individuals have incorporated into the self&rdquo; (p. 39), and EM-identified regulation - &ldquo;individuals invest energy in an activity because they have chosen to do so for personally relevant reasons&rdquo; (p. 39). These three types of extrinsic motivation are presented in order of increasing self-determination. The external regulation is the least self-determined form of EM in the sense that if the external factor determining the motivation to learn a second language was removed, the learning process would just stop as there would be no more reason to spend any effort on it. The introjected regulation is more self-determined than the external regulation because in this case the push to learn a second language comes as a response to &ldquo;some type of pressure that the individual has incorporated into the self, such that they compel to carry out that activity&rdquo;. The most self-determined type of EM is the identified regulation. In this case the reasons to engage in the learning process are fully internalised and &ldquo;students would carry out the activity because of its importance for achieving a valued goal&rdquo;.</p>

<p>- Noels et al. (2003) attempted to use these six motivation types and four types of orientations (travel, knowledge, friendship and instrumental orientations) to predict motivation in second language learning. In particular, the authors used as criterion measurements antecedents (self-perceived competence and freedom of choice) and consequences (anxiety and intention to continue) of motivation. Key finding: more self-determined types of motivation are more closely linked with the antecedents and consequences of motivation, it was the identified regulation which correlated best with them. This led the authors to the conclusion that it may be not enough to present the experience of learning a second language as an enjoyable and satisfying activity to do to persuade students to learn (i.e., leveraging on their intrinsic motivation). It is also important to convince students that second language learning is very important personally for them (i.e. leveraging on the identified regulation).</p>

<p>3.3 Higgins&rsquo; self-discrepancy theory</p>

<p>Higgins: 2 types of self-regulating systems: with a positiveand with a negative reference. + reference: tries to reduce the discrepancy between the actual state and a desired end state. - system tries to amplify the discrepancy between the actual state and an undesired end state. In this context, motivation is an example of a self-regulating system with a positive reference and its goal is to reduce the discrepancy between the perception of the current self and the desired end states, which are also called self guides. Higgins hypothesises the existence of two different types of self guides: the ideal self and the ought self.</p>

<p>The ideal selves are &ldquo;individuals&rsquo; representations of the attributes that someone (themselves or another person) would like them ideally to possess, someone&rsquo;s hopes, wishes, or aspirations for them&rdquo;. The ought selves are &ldquo;individuals&rsquo; representations of the attributes that someone believes they should or ought to possess. Specifically: &ldquo;the psychological situations involved in ideal self-regulation are the presence and absence of positive outcomes&rdquo;. In this context the strategy of approaching a match pertains to the ideal self guide, while the strategy of avoiding a mismatch pertains to the ought self guide. Discrepancy between current self and ideal self is more likely to trigger dejection types of emotions (disappointment, dissatisfaction, sadness), whereas a discrepancy between current self and ought self is more likely to trigger agitation types of emotions (feeling uneasy, threatened, afraid). In terms of self-regulation focus, the ideal self is related to the presence of a promotion focus, while the ought self to the presence of a prevention focus.</p>

<p> 3.4 Dornyei&#39;s L2 Self Motivation System</p>

<p>Dornyei&#39;s Motivation theory is largely based on Gardner and Lambert&#39;s (1959) concept of integrative motivation, the study of &lsquo;possible selves&rsquo; and Higgin;s &lsquo;future self guides&rsquo; . 3 types of language learning motivation. The first is the ideal L2 self, i.e. what we really want to be. The other part of language learning motivationis the so called &lsquo;ought-to L2 Self&rsquo; - what language users learners have to become So, the factors here are more extrinsic, and not so internalised as in the ones that go under the umbrella term of &lsquo;Ideal L2 Self&rsquo;. The 3d factor is the &lsquo;L2 Learning Experience&rsquo;, which covers all the various circumstances and situations that happen in the classroom and that influence motivation.</p>

<p>- The 3 elements of the L2 Motivational Self System (ideal L2 self, ought-to L2 self and L2 learning experience) are similar to the 3 areas of integrativeness, instrumentality and attitude towards the learning situation that are part of the AMTB of Gardner&#39;s. L2 Motivational Self System is also in line with Noels&#39; theory,similarities between D&ouml;rnyei&#39;s ideal L2 self, ought-to L2 self and L2 learning experience and Noels&rsquo; identified regulation, introjected regulation and intrinsic motivation respectively.</p>

<p>Difference Dornyei&rsquo;s vs Gardner: focus is on intended effort and language choice for future studies as best measures of motivation, while Gardner tries to predict language achievement as criterion measure.</p>

<p>- Similarities with Ushioda&rsquo;s motivation construct. D&ouml;rnyei: 8 elements could be reorganised in three bigger groups: actual learning process, external pressures/incentives, and integrative disposition.</p>

<p>The L2 Motivational Self System has been tested multiple times and validated in different contexts, including six different countries, various learner groups (urban versus rural background, English versus non-English university students, various age groups), with big samples.</p>

<p>- Teimouri&rsquo;s study: Ideal L2 self/own and Ought-to L2 self/others and does not account for the other two possible self guides - .</p>

<p>Weaknesses: Lamb - failure to even properly measure the Ought-to L2 self, given the low reliability of the scale - .the respondents were too young, and so not yet capable of incorporating the pressure from the external environment (which is an important component of the Ought-to L2 self guide) within the self. Also conclusive results only in urban areas. This seems to suggest that Dornyei&rsquo;s theory is not generalisable to all contexts.</p>

<p>FIXING with Taguchi&#39;s questionnaire: a detailed ways to measure this element, by including different types of external factors and handling them separately. The questionnaire added scales addressing promotional and preventiveinstrumental motives. They are both types of external factors attempting to measure the ought-to L2 self.</p>

<p>The sample employed in this study was very diverse and it was including middle school, university students and working professionals with a pretty wide age range This study confirmed that the key aspects of Dornyei&rsquo;s model hold in all three countries. This confirms the hypothesis that the Ideal L2 self concept can better explain motivated behaviour than the integrativeness from Gardner&rsquo;s socio-educational model. Additionally, the Ideal L2 self and integrativeness were positively correlated between each other, showing that they both tap in the same construct. However, given the Ideal L2 self can better explain the criterion measure, it can replace integrativeness. One other important conclusion relates to the two different types of instrumental motives (promotional and preventional) that were measured through the questionnaire. These two types of instrumental motives did not correlate with each other, showing that they represent distinct aspects of instrumentality.</p>

<p>3.5 Latest developments in L2 learning motivation theories</p>

<p>All theories presented so far have tried to explain what promotes motivation in second language acquisition. One concept that was proposed to extend the L2 self motivation system is the concept of &lsquo;Ideal multilingual self&rsquo; (Ushioda). This concept describes the desire to become multilingual.</p>

<p>Another observation: all current theories represent motivation as static, which is actually not the case. Motivation is dynamic as students go through ups and downs in motivation during the learning process. &ldquo;Big Five model&rdquo; from McAdams &amp; Pals, &ldquo;which has 3 key personality traits : dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations, integrative life narratives. Thus, understanding the dynamic interactions between self guides may be even more relevant in case of learning more than one language at a time. A relevant aspect to consider, taking into account its temporal nature, is what sustains motivation in the long term, in addition to what generates motivation, given second language acquisition can be a slow process. To answer this question, Dornyei proposes three concepts: vision, directed motivational currents and student engagement.</p>

<p>- Including these new concepts reviewed in this section (Ideal multilingual self, group dynamics, temporal dimension of motivation) to the current theories of motivation in second language learning acquisition can help to understand this concept more completely and can help teachers to maximise the students&rsquo; second language proficiency.</p>

<p>3.6 The Ideal multilingual self</p>

<p>Henry and Thorsen - The Ideal multilingual self is an additional self guide that can develop from different Ideal L2 self guides on different second languages. When there are different Ideal L2 self guides on different languages (also denoted in literature by Ideal Lx and Ideal Ly), there could be interactions triggered by cross linguistic influences and if the interactions are complementary the Ideal multilingual self guide can develop. In other words, students desire to learn Lx and Ly (driven by the Ideal Lx and Ly self guides) and they also desire to become plurilingual (because of the Ideal multilingual self guide).</p>

<p>In summary, the different hypothesis presented pointed to the fact that the Ideal multilingual self is a higher level function tapping into a &ldquo;broader and more diffuse dimension of a nascent identity&rdquo;, it requires a higher level of abstraction as it is less mentally connected to learning a specific language at school, and it might have not been fully developed yet in the target group subject of the study. This suggests that it might be harder for the Ideal multilingual self to emerge from empirical studies given the higher level of abstraction of this self guide and the fact that it may take longer to develop in students, as it may only have a direct relation to the intended effort once the nascent multilingual identity is fully formed.</p>

<p>3.7 Summary</p>

<p>The first theory that dominated this field is Gardner&rsquo;s socio education model of second language learning, according to which the concept of integrativeness, which is an individual&rsquo;s openness to take on features of another cultural or linguistic group, plays a very important role in second language learning motivation, and students who have very high integrative motives typically manage to have better language achievements compared to students who are not as highly integratively motivated. On the other hand, instrumental motives are related to language achievement to a lower extent compared to integrative motives.</p>

<p>Noels distinguishes two main types of motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic motivation is a more self determined type of motivation than the extrinsic one and is associated to a higher degree to self perceived competence and intention to continue to learn the language.</p>

<p>Dornyei established the L2 self motivation system which introduces the concepts of Ideal L2 self and Ought-to L2 self. The Ideal L2 self guide has a similar role as integrativeness in Gardner&rsquo;s socio educational model and that in fact integrativeness should be replaced by the broader concept of Ideal L2 self which would be relevant also in case of foreign language learning motivation. Dornyei also introduced the concept &lsquo;L2 Learning Experience&rsquo;, which covers all the various circumstances and situations that happen in the classroom and that influence motivation, and is also very relevant in predicting motivation.</p>

<p>Henry and Thorsen examined a new self guide, the Ideal multilingual self, that can develop if there are more Ideal L2 self guides for different languages and if there are complementary interactions between the different Ideal L2 self guides, fuelled by cross linguistic influences.</p>

<p>Similarities can be found among the concepts introduced in the different theories, specifically among the concepts of instrumentality, extrinsic motivation and Ought to L2 self on one hand and integrativeness, intrinsic motivation and Ideal L2 self on the other hand. All theories deal with the study of motivation of specific target groups at a certain point in time and have been tested in many research studies, in different contexts and parts of the world. These studies though are cross sectional rather than longitudinal and do not tackle the aspect of temporal evolution of motivation. More recently, Dornyei and Ryan have tried to address the temporal nature of motivation recurring to instruments from psychological theories, namely the Big Five model from McAdams and Pals which includes personality traits that are contextualised in time and that could be useful in the study of second language acquisition.</p>

            <p>IV. Research Question and Methodology</p>

<p>4.1 Research question</p>

<p>Considering that Dornyei&#39;s theory unites and adds to previous theories in the field of motivation studies, I have chosen to implement this theory to explore the motivation of a group of 40 L2 learners and identify the most important factors associated with motivation.</p>

<p>The question central to my research is: &ldquo;What are the L2 motivational characteristics of international expatriates in Brussels who study English as a second language? &ldquo;</p>

<p>In this research project, I have employed Taguchi&#39;s questionnaire to understand the English language learning motivation drivers of this specific students group of expatriates in Brussels. The project describes and analyses a small-scale survey aiming to define the L2 motivational characteristics of international expatriates in Brussels currently studying English, in order to find out if they are similar to the motivational patterns described in other studies. This questionnaire has been tested extensively and used in large and small scale studies (Taguchi and Markova). Therefore, this questionnaire can be a powerful tool also for the present research project to better understand the motivation drivers of specific smaller groups of learners within a context that has not been addressed yet by previous research (expatriates in Brussels learning English) and give teachers valuable insights on how to manage the students&#39; learning experience in the most effective way. In the case of expatriates, one could expect the presence of more instrumental motives linked to language learning motivation.. Moreover, the age of the group of expats subject of the present research is in the range of 20 &ndash; 58 years old which is older compared with the age range of the target group mentioned in most of the aforementioned studies (13-14 y.o. in Csizer &amp; Dornyei, 2005). Age may also affect motivational behaviour in the sense that instrumental motives (more linked with the Ought-to L2 self dimension) may be more present in older rather than younger individuals. Therefore, it would not be surprising to find positive correlations between the Ought-to L2 self, or areas related to it, and the motivated behaviour, as outcome of the present research study.</p>

<p> - Given the profile of the respondents it may have been interesting to include questions related to the Ideal multilingual self to try to study this self guide too. However, the Ideal multilingual self could be hard to detect as it could be easily confounded with the Ideal L2 self. Henry and Thorsen (2017) did manage to separate the two constructs, however their study was on a much larger sample size (N = 323) compared with the study of the present research (N = 40). Furthermore, given the lack of previous literature on expatriates&rsquo; motivation to learn English and the small scale nature of this study, it would be preferrable to use a tool that has been already tested multiple times, like Taguchi&rsquo;s questionnaire, both in large and small scale studies.</p>

<p>4.2 Methodology</p>

<p>4.2.1 Participants</p>

<p>The survey participants were 40 foreign expatriates in Brussels (Belgium), in the age range 20 &ndash; 58 years. 90% of the participants though were in the age range of 20 &ndash; 40, the remaining 10% being over 40 years old. . There are in total 17 countries of origin, across 3 different continents though most of them are in Europe (10 in Europe, 5 in Asia and 2 in Latin America).</p>

<p>- 27.5% of the respondents were male and 72.5% female.</p>

<p>Participation was voluntary and anonymous. The data collection took place between June and July 2021. The questionnaire was shared via a Google Forms link to the students that had enrolled for an intermediate English course at the Saint Josse Language Centre (Brussels).</p>

<p>4.2.2 Instrument</p>

<p>The Iranian version of the questionnaire used in Taguchi et al.&rsquo;s (2009) study was used, as considered the most appropriate for this research context, including the same adaptations mentioned by Markova &amp; Yaneva (2020) as also in the case of the foreign expatriates to Belgium the questions addressing beliefs related to Islam and Islamic culture are a sensitive issue in Belgian society at present. Hence, the questionnaire consisted of 73 six-level Likert items which range from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (6) for the statements in Part I, and from not at all (1) to very much (6) for the questions in Part II. Multiple items were used to target the same motivation variable. In total the 73 items target 14 motivation variables which are listed below.</p>

<p>5.1 Reliability analysis</p>

<p>Reliability analysis was conducted on all variables to measure the consistency of the scales through Cronbach&lsquo;s alpha. Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha was calculated in Excel using the definition formula:</p>

<p>Where k is the number of question items used to describe the variable (for example 6 for the criterion measure, 8 for instrumentality prevention, 3 for travel orientation, etc.), var aggregate is the variance of the sum of the scores of all questions describing the variable and var question i is the variance of the score of each question describing the variable (indicated with the index i which also appears as summation index).</p>

<p>The table below reports the values of the Cronbach&rsquo;s alphas for the different variables.</p>

<p>Table 4. Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha for the different variables in the study</p>

<p>All of the variables, excluding integrativeness and attitudes towards L2 community, have a Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha above 0.6 which shows sufficient internal consistency of the subscales for these variables. On the other hand, integrativeness and attitudes towards the L2 community show a Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha below 0.6, which shows an insufficient consistency of the subscales. The threshold of 0.6 is the one commonly adopted in literature as a minimum threshold to determine whether the scales are acceptably reliable (Lamb, 2012). To solve the issue of the low consistency of integrativeness and attitudes towards the L2 community, it was investigated whether removing one or more question items from these variables could help in increasing the Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha above 0.6. For integrativeness, by removing question item 70 (&ldquo;How much do you like English?&ldquo;) the Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha increased from 0.48 to 0.55, which is still below the threshold of 0.6. Trying to remove any other question instead would reduce the Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha even further. The same conclusion is valid for Attitudes towards L2 community. For this variable, by removing question item 63 (&ldquo;Do you like to travel to English-speaking countries?&ldquo;) the Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha increased from 0.55 to 0.57, which is still below 0.6. As it was not possible to optimise the subscale items to reach a satisfactory scale consistency, the variables integrativeness and attitudes towards L2 community have been excluded from the subsequent analysis. This result suggests that the student subject group of this study may seem to not clearly identify an L2 English speaking community, and the willingness or desire to take on characteristics and behaviours of the L2 community (integrativeness) and the attitudes towards the L2 community do not seem to make much sense in this case. This could be due to the highly globalised context in which this specific student group lives, Brussels, a very cosmopolitan city, where global English is spoken by people from different nationalities and with different cultural backgrounds. This hypothesis has been formulated before. For instance, as Lamb (2012) puts it,</p>

<p>for many learners around the world it [L2] is no longer associated with any particular ethnic or national group but may instead be identified with either more educated and cosmopolitan members of one&rsquo;s own group, or with an amorphous imagined community of international English users. (Lamb, 2012, p.1000).</p>

<p>It is important to note that while integrativeness does not show a good enough reliability, the Ideal L2 self does. This result confirms Dornyei&rsquo;s position according to which the Ideal L2 self is more suitable than integrativeness to predict motivated behaviour.</p>

<p>5.2 Mean scores analysis</p>

<p>The table below presents the mean value of the motivation variables of the surveyed group and of the female and male subgroups.</p>

<p>Ideal L2 self</p>

<p>Travel orientation</p>

<p>Fear of assimilation</p>

<p>Ethnocentrism</p>

<p>English anxiety</p>


<p>Cultural interest</p>


<p>Table 5: Mean scores for each variable, including gender breakdown</p>

<p>The highest average scores (5 or above) were attained for the variables Ideal L2 self, Instrumentality Promotion, Travel Orientation, and Cultural Interest. These are all variables expected to be linked to the Ideal L2 self domain. This is in line with the participants&rsquo; profile: as foreign expat students a positive attitude towards travel, intercultural experiences and in general different communities from the ones of their own country of origin is critical to ensure a successful academic and future work career.</p>

<p>The lowest average scores (2.2) were attained for the variables Ethnocentrism and English anxiety. This is also expected based on the participants&rsquo; profile. Students who are willing to travel abroad and learn a new language must definitely overcome the anxiety to speak English with others and the fear of making mistakes for a successful integration in the foreign country and would not be willing to travel abroad in the first place if they were convinced that their country of origin is the best place to be. This result is in line with other studies where the same two motivation variables scored the lowest averages (Markova &amp; Yaneva, 2020). In particular in this work from Markova &amp; Yaneva (2020) the target group subject of the study are students in International Relations who are likely to have a positive and open attitude towards different cultures, given the choice of their degree. Therefore, it is understandable they would also have low scores on Ethnocentrism and English Anxiety like the expatriates in Brussels.</p>

<p>The motivation variables Ought-to L2 self, Parental Encouragement and Fear of Assimilation scored the lowest averages if one excludes Ethnocentrism and English anxiety. This is again in line with other English language learning motivation studies (You and Dornyei, 2016; Markova &amp; Yaneva, 2020) where the variables linked to the ought-to L2 self area scored the lowest average results. Especially when it comes to Fear of Assimilation, it is understandable that both profiles of expats in Brussels and students who have chosen to pursue a career in International Relations (target group in Markova &amp; Yaneva &rsquo;s study) give similar low scores, as for both profiles intercultural communication and assimilation to other cultural groups are important parts of life and/or career.</p>

<p>The average scores were pretty consistent between the genders, however for the Intended effort, Ideal L2 self and Attitudes towards Learning English the average scores of the female group are more than 0.5 points higher than the ones of the male group, showing that these areas seem to be more developed in women rather than men.</p>

<p>5.3 Correlation analysis</p>

<p>The correlation matrix below shows in one overview the correlation factors between pairs of motivation variables.</p>

<p>Table 6: correlation matrix between all variables</p>

<p>Correlations between motivation variables and Intended Effort</p>

<p>The motivation-effort correlation factors can be read in the first column, which contains all correlation factors between the different motivation variables and the Criterion measure (intended effort). The intended effort (just the mention &lsquo;effort&lsquo; is used in the table to save space) shows a statistically significant correlation at 99% confidence with the variables: Attitudes towards learning English (r = 0.73), Instrumentality Promotion (r = 0.44), Travel Orientation (r = 0.43) and a statistically significant correlation at 95% confidence with the variables: Instrumentality Prevention (r = 0.39), English Anxiety (r = 0.37), and Parental Encouragement (r = 0.35). The correlation with Attitudes towards learning English is strong, as it has a correlation coefficient r above 0.7, whereas the correlation with the other variables is moderate as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009).</p>

<p>It seems that the encouragement these foreign expat students find in learning English is related to their positive attitude towards learning English and their enjoyment of the learning experience. This may be because in the context of the foreign expat students in Belgium, the English lessons are not only needed to improve the English language skills, but are also perceived as an opportunity for social interaction, cultural exchange and network building, much needed and uplifting for students who have left their home country and might feel lonely and disoriented in a foreign country. This observation is in line with previous publications: as Marta Zielinska (2017) suggests in her article about how to handle loneliness in expatriates, language exchange activities are a great way to meet new people. Also in Tom Czaban&lsquo;s (2020) interview of an &ldquo;expat expert&ldquo; the interviewee suggests language exchange activities as a way to make friends when being abroad. Nevertheless, the strong correlation between the Intended Effort and Attitudes Towards Learning English is not surprising as it is a common result also from previous studies (Lamb, 2012; You and Dorney, 2016; Markova &amp; Yaneva, 2020). Furthermore, in these studies the variable Attitudes Towards Learning English has the highest correlation factor with the Intended Effort, which is in tune with this aspect of the present study findings.</p>

<p>Other important factors correlating with the intended effort are related to the instrumentality (both in a promotional or preventive aspect) and travel orientation. This is expected given the participants&rsquo; profiles. Foreign expat students of English see the importance of mastering the language to make future career opportunities possible for them and expand their travel opportunities. In her article, Yasim Pereira (n.d.) includes travelling and working/studying abroad among the five top reasons that propel expats to learn a new language. These are all motivational factors that are meaningful for this students category. This is consistent with previous research: for instance, international experience, job condition and labour market situation were three of the main factors motivating the expatriates interviewed in Froese&rsquo;s (2012) study to move to Korea. Most of these variables relate to the Ought-to L2 self domain. In particular the motivation variables: Travel Orientation, Instrumentality-promotion, Instrumentality-prevention and Parental Encouragement are also strongly correlated to the Ought-to L2 self (correlations between Ought-to L2 self and other motivation variables will be discussed in more details later). Moreover, English Anxiety, though not directly correlated with the Ought-to L2 self, shows a significant correlation with the Instrumentality-prevention, which is correlated both with the Ought-to L2 self and the Intended Effort. The motivational impact of anxiety in a prevention focused learners has been theorised before. According to Teimouri (2016), &ldquo;anxiety fits prevention-focused learners in stimulating them to expand more vigilant efforts to avoid the presence of negative outcomes. Thus, it is beneficial for their motivation.&ldquo; (p. 689).</p>

<p>Given this, it seems that for this English language students sample, the Ought-to L2 self might play a bigger role than the Ideal L2 self in the way it is connected to the learning intended effort, though there seems to be no strong direct correlation between either the Ought-to L2 self or the Ideal L2 self variable to the Intended Effort variable. This is not in line with previous studies (Taguchi et al., 2009; Dorney and Chan, 2013; Markova &amp; Yaneva, 2020) which show that the Ideal L2 self and the variables related to it are more closely connected to the language learning intended effort than the Ought-to L2 self. This might be due to the specific target group subject of this study which is different from the previous studies quoted. In particular, the Ideal L2 self might not be a strong enough self guide in this case to trigger motivation, in the sense of the process of reducing the discrepancy between the current self and the self guide. As mentioned in the theoretical overview section, it could be that in case of highly globalised contexts there is not enough discrepancy between the current perceived self and the ideal L2 English specific self guide, therefore the Ideal L2 self guide might not be able to explain motivated behaviour in these contexts (Henry and Cliffordson, 2017), and the concept of &lsquo;Ideal multilingual self&lsquo; might be more appropriate to explain motivated behaviour. It could be interesting to repeat a similar study in the future, using a larger sample, including a measure of the Ideal multilingual self construct to verify whether it could indeed significantly correlate with the Intended Effort. This study also confirms the result found in previous research that the Ought-to L2 self cannot explain the criterion measure. For instance, Taguchi at al. (2009) could not find a significant correlation between the Ought-to L2 self in their study on Japanese, Chinese and Iranian students and Martin Lamb (2012) could not even properly measure the Ought-to L2 self due to the lack of reliability of the scale. In the present study, the reliability of the Ought-to L2 self scale is good, as the Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha is rather high (0.82), however the Ought-to L2 self does not correlate directly with the Intended Effort. Though the Ought-to L2 self does not correlate with the Intended Effort, four of the five variables correlating with the Intended Effort are also correlated with the Ought-to L2 self (Parental Encouragement, Instrumentality promotion, Instrumentality prevention and Travel Orientation). This suggests that the Ought-to L2 self might actually be an important motivating self guide for this specific students group. However, its correlation with the criterion measure does not come out directly from the analysis, potentially due to issues with the measurement of this variable.</p>

<p>Correlations between Ideal L2 self and other motivation variables</p>

<p>The Ideal L2 self variable showed statistically significant correlation at 95% confidence only with Instrumentality-promotion (r = 0.38). This is a moderate correlation, as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009). This is in line with the theory and previous studies showing that the Ideal L2 self has typically a strong correlation with Instrumentality-promotion (Higgins, 1998; Dornyei, 2009; Taguchi et al., 2009; Markova &amp; Yaneva, 2020), though the actual value of the correlation factors from this study is lower than the correlation factors found in previous studies (r &gt; 0.5). The correlation result from this study reinforces the point that the promotion focus is an important pillar of the ideal self guide, and that the Ideal L2 self is professionally successful (on top of being personally agreeable). The lack of correlation between Ideal L2 self and the instrumentality-prevention also confirms the promotion focus of the Ideal L2 self guide as opposed to the prevention focus of the Ought-to L2 self guide. The lack of correlation between the Ideal L2 self and family influence (which is strongly correlated to the Ought-to L2 self instead) shows once again that the family influence is more linked to the Ought-to L2 rather than the Ideal L2 self construct, corroborating previous results leading to the same conclusion (Taguchi et al., 2009; Markova &amp; Yaneva, 2020). Previous studies (Taguchi et al., 2009) have also found significant positive correlation between the Ideal L2 self and integrativeness (concluding that Ideal L2 self and integrativeness tap into the same construct, though Ideal L2 self has a higher correlation with the criterion measure than integrativeness does) and the Ideal L2 self and Attitudes towards the L2 community, which led to the authors&lsquo; conclusion that the Ideal L2 self is personally agreeable. These correlations could not be seen in this study because of the lack of reliability of the integrativeness and Attitudes towards L2 community scales.</p>

<p>Correlations between Ought-to L2 self and other motivation variables</p>

<p>The Ought-to L2 self motivation variable showed statistically significant correlation at 99% confidence with Family Influence (r = 0.77), Instrumentality-prevention (r = 0.69), Fear of Assimilation (r = 0.52), Travel Orientation (r = 0.42) and Instrumentality-promotion (r = 0.40). The correlation with Family Influence is strong, as it has a correlation coefficient r above 0.7, whereas the correlation with the other variables is moderate as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009). The first two correlations with Family Influence and Instrumentality-prevention are not at all surprising. It has been shown previously that motives that typically have a prevention focus and are coming from the external environment, like pressure from parents, enter into the ought-to self guide. Similar results and conclusions have been reached by Higgins (1998), Dornyei (2009) and Markova and Yaneva (2020) for other subject groups. It is also worth to note the significant correlation, though with a lower correlation factor, between the Ought-to L2 self and the Instrumentality-promotion. This is again not new and is a result common to other research work (Taguchi et al, 2009; Markova &amp; Yaneva, 2020). There might be different reasons that might explain this correlation. In particular, Taguchi et al. (2009) hypothesise that parents invest in their children and expect the same attitude in return (in the context of the Chinese and Iranian groups subject of their study) and this might explain the high correlation between these two variables. One other possible explanation is the one provided by Teimouri (2016) who points out potential limitations of the questionnaire to describe the ought-to L2 self, as some questions refer to the presence or absence of positive outcomes (like &lsquo;Studying English is important to me in order to gain the approval of my peers/teachers/family/boss&rsquo;) and other questions refer to the presence or absence of negative outcomes (like &lsquo;If I fail to learn English, I will be letting other people down&rsquo;). It is not unreasonable that also in the context of foreign expat students, as well as in the Chinese and Iranian contexts, parents may have invested more financially compared with parents of students who did not go abroad to study and therefore they might expect their children also to wisely invest their time in their language education. However, this is not supported by the data of this survey given the lack of correlation between Family Influence and Instrumentality-promotion. A third possible explanation of the presence of a statistically significant correlation between Ought-to L2 self and Instrumentality-promotion is that it is just quite hard to separate the promotion from the prevention aspect of the instrumentality from this data, and the aspect of instrumentality should rather be considered just as a whole and one single entity. This is supported by the statistically significant correlation at 99% confidence between the variables Instrumentality-promotion and Instrumentality-prevention (r = 0.52). Given this, it becomes statistically very hard to try to distinguish the separate effect that these two variables have on the other motivation variables (such as Ideal L2-self or Ought-to L2 self) or on the Intended Effort variable. Markova and Yaneva (2020) also found this correlation between these two variables (r = 0.54). Further research, potentially with a bigger sample size or using qualitative research instruments, may be needed to try to reduce this inter-correlation and understand the separate effects between the two variables.</p>

<p>The correlation between the Ought-to L2 self and Travel Orientation was also found in previous studies. For instance, Markova &amp; Yaneva (2020) also found a positive correlation (r = 0.47, which is very similar to the value of r = 0.42 found in this study) between these two variables. For the group subject of this study, this could be explained by the positive attitude of expats to travelling and the students&rsquo; need to master the English language to continue travelling to meet their personal and career needs. As these are more extrinsic instrumental motives for learning English rather than intrinsic, they closely relate to the Ought-to L2 self construct.</p>

<p>The final correlation of the Ought-to L2 self with Fear of Assimilation is not unexpected. More extrinsic instrumental motives to learn English, pertaining to the Ought-to L2 self sphere, are more likely to be related to the fear of losing the values and traditions from one&rsquo;s country of origin.</p>

<p>Correlations between the parental encouragement/family influence and other motivational variables</p>

<p>Parental encouragement/family influence showed statistically significant correlation at 99% confidence with Instrumentality Prevention (r = 0.69), Fear of Assimilation (r = 0.5), and statistically significant correlation at 95% confidence with Travel Orientation (r = 0.39) and English Anxiety (r = 0.33). All these correlations are moderate as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009). The other correlations between Parental Encouragement and Intended Effort and the Ought-to L2 self have already been analysed above. The correlation between Parental Encouragement and Instrumentality Prevention is not surprising as both variables refer to extrinsic types of motives, rather than intrinsic, that are linked to the Ought-to L2 self guide and have a prevention focus. This correlation was also found in other studies (Markova &amp; Yaneva, 2020) and was used in building structural equation models for the L2 self motivation system in Japanese, Chinese and Iranian contexts (Taguchi et al., 2009).</p>

<p>The correlation between Parental Encouragement and Fear of Assimilation was not found in previous studies, though it is not counterintuitive. Fear of assimilation is expected to be present only in students with very low integrative motives and more extrinsically motivated, whereas students who are willing to integrate with the L2 community or are more intrinsically motivated would score low in Fear of Assimilation. Following the same direction, one would expect that also Parental Encouragement relates more to the less self determined forms of motivation. For the surveyed group in question, one could assume that if the motivation to expatriate to a foreign country to study English is mainly driven by parental encouragement, the student may more likely experience fear to incorporate in the new foreign context, as the motivation to move abroad would be mainly extrinsic rather than intrinsic in this case, or because of the pressure that the student may feel due to the parents&rsquo; expectations.</p>

<p>The correlation between Parental Encouragement and Travel Orientation is open to interpretations. It is quite understandable that English language students who are expatriates in Belgium have a positive predisposition to travel, and this correlation might suggest that this attitude is inherited by their parents or family. Also, both Parental Encouragement and Travel Orientation are linked to the dimensions of the Ought-to L2 self (they both have significant correlations with the Ought-to L2 self), therefore a positive correlation between these two variables is imaginable. The correlation between Parental encouragement and English Anxiety has also been found in previous studies (Markova &amp; Yaneva, 2020). Anxiety might be triggered by the expectations of parents towards their children. Other authors also agree with this conclusion (Papi, 2010). Moreover, Teimouri (2016) introduces the concept of the Ought-to L2 self/others which describes attributes one is expected by others (including family) to have. This is the most extrinsic type of self guide and its discrepancy with the current perceived self can generate feelings of anxiety.</p>

<p>Correlations between Instrumentality Promotion and other motivational variables</p>

<p>Instrumentality Promotion showed a statistically significant correlation at 99% confidence with Travel orientation (r = 0.51) and a statistically significant correlation at 95% confidence with Attitudes towards learning English (r = 0.34). Both correlations are moderate as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009).</p>

<p>The correlations between Instrumentality Promotion and the Intended Effort, the Ideal L2 self, the Ought-to L2 self and the Instrumentality Prevention have already been discussed above.</p>

<p>The correlation between Instrumentality Promotion and Travel Orientation is expected, since the respondents are foreign expatriates English students to Belgium and they need to master the use of English well enough to make sure their experience in the foreign country brings good outcomes, and that they could continue to have successful experiences as expatriates also in other countries. As discussed previously, the two types of instrumentality (promotion and prevention) are highly correlated between each other. It is also found that Travel Orientation correlates not only with Instrumentality Promotion but also with Instrumentality Prevention. This seems to suggest that some students may perceive travelling abroad in a promotional way (e.g. they would need to master the language to have positive experiences abroad, both current and future) and some other students may perceive travelling abroad in a preventional way (e.g. they would like to work after their studies still in the current foreign country where they live or in another foreign country, and they would not be able to do it if they did not know how to communicate in English well enough). This line of thought is also suggested by Taguchi et al. (2009). Moreover, Dornyei and Kormos (2000) also found out as a result of their study, that travel incentives were involved in the instrumental motivational dimension and they introduced the label &lsquo;incentive values&rsquo; to refer to this more complete concept.</p>

<p>The correlation between Instrumentality Promotion and Attitudes towards learning English has been seen in previous studies (Markova &amp; Yaneva, 2020). Students with an instrumental-promotional focus on English language acquisition appreciate the importance of learning English to achieve a valued goal, and this contributes to building a positive attitude towards the language learning, which ultimately determines the effort students intend to spend during the language acquisition process.</p>

<p>Correlations between Instrumentality Prevention and other motivational variables</p>

<p>Instrumentality Prevention showed a statistically significant correlation at 99% confidence with Fear of Assimilation (r = 0.44) and a statistically significant correlation at 95% confidence with English Anxiety (r = 0.35). Both correlations are moderate as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009).</p>

<p>The correlations between Instrumentality Prevention and the Intended Effort, Ought-to L2 self, Parental Encouragement, Instrumentality Promotion and Travel Orientation have been already discussed above.</p>

<p>The other two correlations of Instrumentality Prevention, i.e. with Fear of Assimilation and English Anxiety are not surprising as Fear of Assimilation and English Anxiety are expected to be present in students with less self determined types of motivation which typically have a prevention focus.</p>

<p>Other correlations</p>

<p>The other significant correlations present in the correlation matrix and not discussed so far are the positive correlation between Ethnocentrism and Fear of Assimilation (r = 0.46) and Ethnocentrism and English Anxiety (r = 0.33). Both correlations are moderate as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009). These correlations are understandable. Ethnocentric beliefs, which are mainly about pride and superiority of one&rsquo;s country of origin, can give rise to feelings of anxiety when having to speak a different language from one&rsquo;s own and feelings of fear of being part of a different cultural group.</p>

<p>5.1 Summary of the findings</p>

<p>The objective of this study is to find out the main motivation factors of English language learning for a specific target group, namely foreign expat students of English in an international city like Brussels. The sample size employed in this study was big enough to carry out statistical analysis, though the results and conclusions of this study should not be generalised and application in other contexts should be handled with caution. Taguchi&rsquo;s (2009) questionnaire was used as instrument to identify the main motivational variables related to the intended effort. Taguchi&rsquo;s (2009) questionnaire was formulated in the context of Dornyei&rsquo;s theory of L2 self motivation system. In his theory, Dornyei built on Gardner&rsquo;s socio-education model of second language learning and introduced the new concept of Ideal L2 self, replacing the concept of integrativeness in Gardner&rsquo;s theory, to be able to address the situations where the second language and communities of L2 native speakers are not present or available to the L2 learners group in question (i.e. the case of foreign rather than second language learning), and therefore the concept of integrativeness may not be relevant. The Ought-to L2 self is the other self guide introduced by Dornyei who has leveraged the concepts of ideal and ought-to self guides in Higgin&rsquo;s (1998) self discrepancy theory in mainstream psychology. Similarities can be found among the Ideal L2 and Ought-to L2 self guide in Dornyei&rsquo;s theory, the concepts of integrativeness and instrumentality in Gardner&rsquo;s socio educational model and the ideas of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation introduced by Noels (2003) reapplying Deci and Ryan&rsquo;s (1985) self determination theory. The L2 learning experience is an additional variable introduced in Dornyei&rsquo;s theory to tackle all circumstances and situations that happen in the classroom and that influence motivation.</p>

<p>Some of the results from this study are in agreement with previous research studies having similar objectives but on different English students target groups and with the L2 Motivational Self System.</p>

<p>For instance, participants have given higher scores on average on factors associated with the ideal L2 self compared with the ought-to L2 self. The data from this study supports the link between promotional aspects of motivation with the Ideal L2 self, whereas the factors pertaining to extrinsic motives are closer to the ought-to L2 self.</p>

<p>Other results differ from previous studies. For instance, even though also here the impact of the ought-to L2 self on the learning intended effort is not evident, as the correlation between the Ought-to L2 self and Intended Effort variable is non-significant, most of the factors that strongly correlate with the Intended Effort are also strongly correlating with the Ought-to L2 self. This seems to suggest that the Ought-to L2 self might play a bigger role than the Ideal L2 self on the motivation to study English for this specific group of students. This is not consistent with previous studies (Taguchi et al., 2009; You and Dornyei, 2016) which showed a stronger correlation between the ideal L2 self and the motivated L2 learning behaviour. The absence of predictive power of the Ideal L2 self on the Intended Effort may be related to the highly globalised environment of the specific group subject of this research, and suggests that other concepts, like the Ideal multilingual self might be more suitable to predict the Intended Effort. Further research would be needed to verify whether this hypothesis is correct. Though Ideal L2 self was not predictive of the Intended Effort, the scale showed satisfactory reliability, unlike integrativeness and attitudes towards the L2 community which had to be excluded from the analysis, as their reliability was not high enough. This confirms that the Ideal L2 self is more valuable than integrativeness to explain the motivated behaviour.</p>

<p>One other result which is not in line with the L2 Motivational Self System, however it was also found in previous research studies (Markova &amp; Yaneva, 2020), is the inter-correlation between the promotional and preventive aspect of the instrumentality variable. This does not allow to statistically separate the impacts of these two different aspects of instrumentality on the other motivational variables and the criterion measure. This may be due to the fact that even questions phrased as promotional might have a preventive interpretation in the mind of the respondents. The two types of instrumentality were also both correlated at 99% confidence with the travel orientations. Thus, in this research both instrumentalities and travel orientations should be included in one common concept (called incentive values) which is a strong predictor of the intended effort, together with attitudes towards learning English (Dornyei and Kormos, 2000). More in depth research, perhaps using qualitative research instruments, may be needed to separate these three aspects.</p>

<p>The figure below attempts to visualise how the different motivation variables impact the Intended Effort and how they are interacting between each other.</p>

<p>The figure is built in the following way: it starts with the motivational variables which are correlated with the Intended Effort at 99% confidence (p &lt; 0.01), these are: Attitudes towards learning English, Instrumentality promotion and Travel orientation. The arrows linking the Intended Effort with these three variables represent these correlations and the respective correlation coefficients (r) are reported. As a second step, the variables which are correlated at 95% confidence (p &lt; 0.05) with the Intended Effort and correlated at 99% confidence with the above mentioned three variables are reported. In this case it is only the Instrumentality Prevention which is correlated at 95% confidence with the Intended Effort and at 99% confidence with both Instrumentality Promotion and Travel Orientation. The arrows linking Instrumentality Prevention with Instrumentality Promotion and Travel Orientation represent these correlations (at 99% confidence) and the respective correlation coefficients (r) are reported. As third and last step, the variables which are correlated at 95% confidence with the Intended Effort and at 99% confidence with Instrumentality Prevention (the last variable included in the figure) are added. There is only one variable which meets these criteria, and that is Parental Encouragement. Again, the correlation at 99% confidence between Parental Encouragement and Instrumentality Prevention is represented by the arrow and the corresponding correlation coefficient (r) is reported. There are no more variables correlated at 95% confidence with the Intended Effort and at 99% confidence with any of the variables already included in the figure. From the figure it is easier to visualise that Instrumentality Promotion, Travel Orientation and Instrumentality Prevention are correlated among each other at 99% confidence, and so they should be included in one common concept (incentive values represented by the green box). As mentioned previously, this is consistent with the approach followed by other authors (Dornyei and Kormos, 2000).</p>

<p>Finally, the variables which are correlated with the Ideal L2 self are represented in italic font (only one, i.e. Instrumentality-promotion) and the variables which are correlated with the Ought-to L2 self are represented in underlined font (four variables, i.e.: Instrumentality-promotion, Instrumentality-prevention, Travel orientation and Parental encouragement). As there are more variables correlating with the Ought-to L2 self than the ones correlating with the Ideal L2 self, there is some indication that the Ought-to L2 self may be playing a more important role than the Ideal L2 self on motivated behaviour and intended effort, though neither the Ought-to L2 self nor the Ideal L2 self directly correlate with the intended effort as a result of this study.</p>

<p>Figure 7: Visualisation of variables affecting intended effort and how they relate to each other. Italic font indicates the variable is also correlated with the Ideal L2 self. Underlined font indicates the variable is also correlated with the Ought to L2 self.</p>

<p>5.2 Pedagogic applications</p>

<p>The results of this study could help English teachers dealing with foreign expat students to adapt their lessons and teaching approach in a way to maximise the students&rsquo; motivation. The strongest factor emerging from this study that relates to the effort students intend to invest in studying English is the Attitudes towards learning English. On that account, a good advice for teachers could be to make sure the whole English learning experience is pleasant and enjoyable, for instance by giving enough opportunities to the students to connect among each other during the lessons, thus helping them build a network away from home. The second strongest factor associated with the intended effort is represented by the Incentive Values. Therefore, one other recommendation for teachers who want to increase their students&rsquo; motivation could be to leverage the value students place in mastering English as a means to expand their work, study and travel possibilities further. Sharing success stories of expats who managed to grasp a good career opportunity thanks to their English language skills could be a way to achieve this outcome. Certainly, it is not always the case that each expat student&rsquo;s motivation will increase on every occasion if and only if this advice is followed, however these recommendations represent a few insights on how the results of this study could be used in an actual teaching context to drive language learning motivation.</p>
