         1. "WHAT DOES A BOUNDARY LOOK LIKE?": 
         

I. What are boundaries? And what does a boundary look like?
Gen 1:28 “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”
Made in the image of God, we were created to take responsibility for certain tasks. Part of taking responsibility, or ownership, is knowing what our job is, and what is not.
Any confusion of responsibility or ownership in our lives is a problem of boundaries. We need to set mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual boundaries for our lives to help us distinguish what is our responsibility and what is not.
Many sincere, dedicated believers struggle with tremendous confusion about when it is biblically appropriate to set limits. Have you ever asked yourself the following questions?
1. Can I set limits and still be a loving person?
2. What are legitimate boundaries?
3. What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries?
4. How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money?
5. Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries?
6. How do boundaries relate to mutual submission within marriage?
7. Aren’t boundaries selfish?
Physical boundaries are easy to see – stop signs, property lines, fences, walls, etc. Spiritual boundaries are just as real but harder to see. This first chapter is to help you define your boundaries.
A. Me and not Me
A boundary shows me where I end and where another begins. Knowing what I am to own and take responsibility for gives me freedom. Taking responsibility for my life opens up many different options. 
Prov 14:10 “Each heart knows its own bitterness, and no one else can share its joys.”
We have the responsibility to deal with what is in our soul. The Bible tells us clearly what our parameters are and how to protect them. In addition to showing us what we are responsible for, boundaries help us define what is not our responsibility. Nowhere are we commanded to have “over-control”.
B. To and For
We are responsible TO others and FOR ourselves.
Gal 6:2 “Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way, you will fulfill the law of Christ.”
Denying ourselves to do for others what they CANNOT do for themselves is showing the sacrificial love of Christ. This is being responsible TO.
Gal 6:5 “each one should carry their own load.”
No one can do certain things FOR us. We have to carry/take responsibility for certain aspects of our lives that are our own “load”.
Problems arise when people act as if their “boulders” are daily loads and refuse help, or as if their “daily loads” are boulders they shouldn’t have to carry.
C. Good in, Bad out
Boundaries help is to distinguish our property so that we can take care of it. We need to keep things that will nurture us inside our fences and keep things that will harm us outside.
Sometimes we have the bad on the inside and good on the outside. In this case, we need to be able to open up our boundaries to let the good in and the bad out. Our fences need gates in them.
Some of us have pain or sin within, and we need to open up and communicate with God and others about this, so that we can be healed. 
James 5:16a “Therefore confess your sons to one another [your false steps, your offenses], and pray for one another, that you may be healed and restored.”
Some of us need to open up our gates and allow Jesus and His truth in. Also, other people have good things to give us and we need to learn to open our hearts to them. 2 Cor 6:11-13
D. God and boundaries
The concept of boundaries comes from the very nature of God. He defines Himself as a distinct, separate being, and He is responsible for Himself. He tells us what He thinks, feels, plans, allows, will not allow, likes and dislikes. He tells us who He is and is not.
God also confronts what He will not allow in His yard. He confronts sin and allows consequences for behavior.
E. Examples of boundaries
a. SKIN
The skin boundary keeps the good in and the bad out. It protects your blood and bones and keeps germs outside protecting you from infection.
b. WORDS
You can create good protective fences with your words. The most basic boundary-setting word is no. It lets others know that you exist apart from them and that you are in control of you. Being clear about your no – and your yes – is a theme that runs throughout the Bible.
People who have difficulty saying no, struggle with saying no to the control, pressure, demands, and sometimes real needs of others. They feel that if they say no to someone, they will endanger their relationship with that person, so they passively comply and inwardly resent. Sometimes the pressure comes from a person pressuring you to do something, sometimes it comes from our own sense of what we “should” do.
It is difficult for people to know where you stand when we do not use words to define our property. God shows us the example when he says: “I like this, and I hate that.” Or “I will do this, and I will not do that.”
c. TRUTH
There is always safety in truth, whether it is knowing God’s truth or the truth about ourselves. When we are in touch with God’s truth, we are in touch with reality. Honesty about who we are gives us the biblical value of integrity, or oneness.
d. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE
Prov 22:3 “the prudent see danger and take refuge;”
Sometimes physically removing oneself from a situation will help maintain boundaries. It can be to replenish yourself as Jesus did when he left the crowds and retired by Himself. Or it can be to remove yourself from an abusive situation, to get away from danger.
e. TIME
Taking time off from a person or a project can be a way to take back your responsibility over some out-of-control aspects in your life. Adult children, for example, may need to spend some time building boundaries in order to create new ways to relate to their parents, since they have outgrown the old ways of relating. This can often lead to an improvement of the relationship between the children and their parents.
f. EMOTIONAL DISTANCE
This is a temporary boundary to allow space for your heart to heal. We should not continue to set ourselves up for hurt and disappointment. Many of us can be too quick to trust someone in the name of forgiveness and not make sure that the other is producing “fruit in keeping with repentance”. (Luke 3:8) It is good to forgive and it is also good to guard your heart.
g. OTHER PEOPLE
Other people are necessary to help us set and keep boundaries. Fear of being alone can keep many in hurtful patterns for years, being too afraid that if they set boundaries, they will not have love in their lives.
Also, many people have been taught by their church or their family that boundaries are unbiblical, mean, or selfish. This will be covered in a later chapter. But we need others to give us new input and teaching about biblical truth concerning boundaries. 
Creating boundaries always involves a support system.
h. CONSEQUENCES
Just as the Bible sets consequences for certain behaviors, we also need to back up our boundaries with consequences. 
2 Thess 3:10 “if anyone will not work, don’t let him/her eat.”
God does not enable irresponsible behavior. Consequences give some “barbs” to fences. They let people know the seriousness of the trespass and the seriousness of our respect for ourselves.
F. What is within my boundaries
a. FEELINGS
Feelings are not always respected for the God given gift they are, especially in the Christian world. They have been called unimportant or fleshly. But they play a huge role in our motivation and behavior. 
Feelings should neither be ignored nor placed in charge. The Bible says to “own” our feelings and be aware of them. Feelings come from the heart and can tell you the state of your relationships.
Our feelings are our responsibility, and we must own them and see them as our problem, so we can begin to find an answer to whatever issue they are pointing to.
b. ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS
Attitudes are the stance you take towards others or something.
Beliefs are anything you accept as true. 
We need to own our attitudes and convictions/beliefs because they fall within our property line. We are the ones who feel their effect and we are the only ones who can change them. 
Those of us with boundary problems usually have a distorted attitude toward responsibility. We think that to hold people accountable for their feelings, choices, and behaviors is mean.
Prov 13: 18, 24
c. BEHAVIORS
Behaviors have consequences. 
Gal 6:7 “A man reaps what he sows”
To rescue people from the natural consequences of their behavior is to render them powerless.
d. CHOICES
We need to take responsibility for our choices. This leads to the fruit of “self-control”. We need to realize that we are in control of our choices, no matter how we feel.
Making choices/decisions based on other’s approval or on guilt breeds resentment.
Setting boundaries inevitably involves taking responsibility for our choices. We are the ones who make them. We are the ones who must live with their consequences. And we are the ones who may be keeping ourselves from making the choices we could be happy with. 
e. VALUES
What we value is what we love and assign importance to.
We often get caught up in valuing the approval of man more than of God.
Boundaries help us not to deny but to own our old hurtful values so God can change them.
f. LIMITS
First the truth is that we do not have the power to set limits on others. What we can do is set limits on our own exposure to people who are not good for us. 
God models this for us. He sets standards, but He lets people be who they are and then separates Himself from them when they misbehave, saying: “You can be that way if you choose, but you cannot come into my house.” Heaven is a place for the repentant and all are welcome.
What we need to learn is to say no to ourselves. We need to allow ourselves to have feelings, impulses, or desires but with self-control/without acting them out.
g. RESSOURCES AND GIFTS
Our talents, given to us by God, are our responsibility. Yet taking ownership of them can often be frightening. It takes work, practice, learning, and grace to overcome the fear of failure that the “wicked and lazy” servant gave in to (see Matt 25:23, 26-28). If we do not confront our fear, we deny God and insult both His giving of the gift and His grace to sustain us as we are learning.
h. THOUGHTS
Establishing boundaries in our thinking involves 3 things
a.i. We must own our own thoughts: We need to weigh the things we hear from other people. We need to examine if we are thinking our own thoughts or if we have accepted thoughts of others. We should never “give our minds” to someone else. We are to weigh things for ourselves in the context of relationship, sharpening each other as iron, but remaining separate thinkers.
a.ii. We must grow in knowledge and expand our minds: we do this by studying God’s word. We also learn about God through His creation. By learning about His world, we obey the commandment to “rule over” the earth and all that is within it.
a.iii. We must clarify distorted thinking: we need to ask God to show us people in our lives as they really are. Taking ownership in relationships requires being active in checking out where we may be wrong. We also need to make sure to communicate our thoughts to others. “For who knows a person’s thoughts except their spirit within them.” (1 Cor 2:11) We have our own thoughts, and if we want others to know them, we must tell them.
i. DESIRES
Our desires are our responsibility. We all have different desires and wants, dreams and wishes, goals and plans, hungers and thirsts.
Many desires can masquerade as the real thing. Sometimes our desire for love and affection can be masquerading as sexual desires.
God is interested in our desires, he made them. And like a good Father, He wants to give us what we truly need. But we don’t always truly know what that is. We need to come to Him to figure that out.
j. LOVE
Our ability to give and respond to love is our greatest gift. The heart that God fashioned in His image is the center of our being.
Our loving heart, like our physical one, needs an inflow as well as an outflow of lifeblood. It is a trust muscle.
Many of us do not take ownership for how we resist love. We have a lot of love around us, but we do not realize that our loneliness is a result of our own lack of responsiveness. We have a responsibility to respond. We need to claim our hearts as our property and work on our weaknesses in that area.


Questions to work on:
Are there relationships in your life that lack boundaries? That feel unsafe? That are too demanding?
What problems have you taken on that God never asked you to take on? What motivated you to take them on?
What do you want to gain from this study on boundaries?
Looking at each example of boundaries: 
Think of an example when people honored that boundary, and consider what hinders you from keeping each boundary strong?
What boundary set up by another person do you need to do a better job honoring?
Why do you have a hard time honoring certain boundaries in other people?
Looking at what is within your boundaries:
In which area are doing a good job taking responsibility?
In what area will you start working on taking more responsibility this week? What will you do? (be specific)

            2. UNDERSTANDING BOUNDARIES: 

          II. 
It is easy to misunderstand boundaries. At first glance, it seems as if the individual who has difficulty setting limits is the one who has the boundary problem; however, people who do not respect other’s limits also have boundary problems.
This summary categorizes the main types of boundary problems. Boundary conflicts are not limited to those who “can’t say no”.
Four types of boundary problems
1. Compliants: saying YES to the bad
Compliant people have fuzzy and indistinct boundaries, they melt into the demands and needs of other people. 
When parents teach children that setting boundaries or saying no is bad, they are teaching them that others can do with them as they wish. Blocking a child’s ability to say No handicaps that child for life. 
Compliants minimize their differences with others so as not to rock the boat. The inability to say no to the bad is pervasive, it keeps them from refusing evil in their lives and often even from recognizing evil. Compliant people are chameleons. 
Here are a couple reasons why some are Compliants:
Fear of hurting others’ feelings
Fear of abandonment and separateness
A wish to be totally dependent on another
Fear of someone else’s anger
Fear of punishment
Fear of being shamed
Fear of being seen as selfish or bad
Fear of being unspiritual
Fear of one’s own overstrict, critical conscience (guilty feelings – condemning oneself for things God Himself does not condemn us for)
2. Avoidants: saying NO to the good 
Avoidance is the inability to ask for help, to recognize one’s own needs and to let others in. Avoidants withdraw when they are in need; they do not ask for the support of others.
Boundaries are supposed to be able to “breathe”, to be like fences with a gate that can let the good in and the bad out. 
Avoidants confuse boundaries for walls. Individuals with walls for boundaries can let in neither bad nor good. No one touches them.
God designed our personal boundaries to have gates. He designed us to enjoy safe relationships and avoid destructive ones. God even allows us the freedom to let him in or to close him off.
3. Controllers: not respecting others’ boundaries
Controllers can’t respect other people’s limits. They resist taking responsibility of their own lives, so they need to control other people’s lives. They are perceived as bullies, manipulative and aggressive. 


There are two types:
Manipulative controllers: they try to persuade people out of their boundaries, they talk others into saying YES. They use guilt messages, manipulate circumstances and seduce others into carrying their burdens. (Example: Isaac’s son Jacob – Gen. 25:29-34 and Gen. 27:1-29) 
Only when the manipulative controller is confronted with their dishonesty can they take responsibility for it, repent of it, and accept their and other’s limits. (only after Jacob wrestled with God did he confront his manipulative boundary-lessness Gen. 32:24-32)

Aggressive controllers: they don’t listen to or respect other people’s boundaries. They run over other people’s fences like a tank. They are sometimes verbally abusive and sometimes physically abusive, but most of the time they simply aren’t aware that others even have boundaries. They neglect their own responsibility to accept others as they are. 
(Peter is an example of an aggressive controller. Peter did not want to accept Jesus’ boundaries. Jesus immediately confronted Peter’s violation of his boundaries. Mark 8:33)
Controllers are undisciplined people. They do a lot of damage to other people, but they themselves have boundary problems as well. Undisciplined they have little ability to delay gratification. 
They are limited in their ability to take responsibility for owning their lives. They desperately need to learn to listen to the boundaries of others to help them observe their own. 
Finally, controllers are isolated. They rarely feel loved because the people around them are there out of fear, guilt or dependency. At some deep level, controllers are aware of their isolation. (“There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear.” 1 John 4:18)
4. Non-responsive: not hearing the needs of others
While we should not take on the responsibility of others’ feelings, attitudes, and behaviors, we do have certain responsibilities to each other. 
Non-responsives struggle with paying attention to the responsibilities of love. That is the opposite of what Prov. 3:27 or Rom. 12:18 exhorts us to do. 
A key phrase here is “in your power” or “so far as it depends on you”. We can’t bring peace to someone who doesn’t accept it.
There are 2 groups: 
- Those with a critical spirit toward others’ needs. 
- Those who are so absorbed in their own desires and needs that they exclude others (a form of narcissism)







How Boundaries are Developped
A. Boundary development
Boundaries aren’t inherited, they are built! God’s desire is for you to know the wounds of your past. The past is your ally in repairing your present and ensuring a better future.
To be the truth-telling, responsible, free, and loving people God wants us to be, we need to learn limits in childhood, when our character is being formed. Good parenting helps children reach that goal (Prov 22:6). Good parenting is being a partner in helping young ones discover what God intended for them to be and helping them reach that goal.
B. Bonding: the foundation of boundary building
A basic need for boundary building is deep, abiding relationships with people who will love you no matter what. We cannot develop or set boundaries apart from supporting relationships with God and others. 
Our deepest need is to belong, to be in a relationship, to have a spiritual and emotional “home”. It is the very nature of God to be in a relationship. The apostle John writes “God is love” and love means relationship – the caring, committed connection of one individual to another. (1 John 4:16) Like God, our most central need is to be connected. 
We are built for relationship. Attachment is the foundation of the soul’s existence. When this foundation is cracked, boundaries become impossible to develop. Because we lack relationship, we have nowhere to go in a conflict. We live in a vacuum. When we are not secure that we are loved, we are forced to choose between 2 bad options: setting limits at the risk of losing a relationship, or not setting limits and remaining a prisoner to the wishes of another person.
When infants successfully complete the first development task – that of bonding with Mom and Dad- they gain the security that comes with knowing they are loved. They develop an internal sense of belonging and safety even away from the presence of their mother. As children learn to feel safe and at home with their primary relationship, they are building good foundations to withstand the separateness and conflict that come with boundary development. It is God’s plan for us to be loved enough by him and others so that we do not feel isolated even when we are alone.
C. Separation and individuation: the construction of the soul
As infants gain a sense of internal safety and attachment, a second need arises. The baby’s need for autonomy, or independence, starts to emerge. 
- Separation: perceiving himself or herself as distinct from Mother, a “not me” experience 
- Individuation: developing an identity, a “me” experience
One must first determine who they are not before they can discover the true, authentic-aspects of their God-given identity.
Luke 2:41-49
In this biblical passage, the only one recorded from Jesus boyhood, we see a young man who knows who he is and who he is not. He has separated from his folks and individuated in his values, thoughts, and opinions. Three phases are critical to this kind of separation and individualization and to the development of healthy boundaries in childhood: hatching, practicing, and rapprochement.
- Hatching “Mommy and I are not the same.”: a time of exploration, of touching, of tasting and feeling new things.
- Practicing “I can do Anything!” (10 m to 18m): I can do anything – toddlers feel exhilaration and energy, with no impulse control, no boundaries on their passions. 
The difference between hatching and practicing is radical. The hatching baby is overwhelmed by this new world and still leans a great deal on Mother, the practicing child is trying to leave her behind!
In the practicing phase, children learn that aggressiveness and taking initiative are good.
- Rapprochement “I can’t do Everything.” (18 m to 3 years): a restoration of harmonious relations. The connection with the Mother is important again but the child brings a more separate self into the relationship. 
Typically, this is a difficult period – toddlers at this stage are temperamental, oppositional, and angry.
Here are some tools toddlers will use to build boundaries:
	- Anger: It was created by God for a purpose – to tell us that there is a problem that needs to be confronted.
	- Ownership: Being created in God’s image also means having ownership, or stewardship. Me, My, Mine are not swear words but they must be applied in the correct way. Without a “mine”, we have no sense of responsibility to develop, nurture, and protect these resources. With good parenting, they will learn sacrifice and develop a giving, loving heart, but not until they have a personality that has been loved enough to give love away (1 John 4:19)
	- No. The one-word boundary: Saying no gives them the power to make choices. It protects them. It is the first verbal boundary children learn. Though they can’t make all the choices they’d like, young children should be able to have a no that is listened to. Children also need to be able not only to give a no but also take a no.
Two additional periods of life focus on boundary building:
	- The adolescent years are a reenactment of the first years of life.
	- Young adulthood is the time when children leave home or college and start a career and/or get married.
The earlier the child learns good boundaries, the less turmoil he or she experiences later in life.
D. Boundary injuries – what goes wrong?
Generally, the earlier and more severe the injury, the deeper the boundary problem.
a. Withdrawal from boundaries: 
Good relationships are built on the freedom to refuse and confront. Prov. 27:17 
Parental limits are crucial. Parents need to stay attached and connected to their children even when they disagree with them. They can get angry, but they should not withdraw. It is crucial that kid’s disagreement, their practices, their experimentation do not result in a withdrawal of love.
b. Hostility against boundaries:
If the parents show hostility, the children do not learn that delayed gratification and being responsible have benefits. They only learn how to avoid someone’s wrath. 
God’s discipline teaches, it does not punish. (Heb 12:10-11)
c. Overcontrol:
It occurs when otherwise loving parents try to protect their children from making mistakes by having too strict rules and limits. The problem with overcontrol is that while a major responsibility of good parents is to control and protect, they must make room for children to make mistakes.
d. Lack of limits:
It is the opposite of hostility, but the resulting injuries can be just as severe. Ultimately no one can really escape the disciplines of life. We always reap what we sow.
e. Inconsistent limits:
Sometimes, due to their confusion about rearing children of their own injuries, some parents combine strict and lax limits, sending conflicting messages to children. Alcoholic families often exhibit inconsistent limits.
f. Trauma:
A trauma is an intensely painful emotional experience rather than a character pattern. A trauma can affect boundary development because it shakes up two necessary foundations to children’s growth (i) the world is reasonably safe, and (ii) they have control over their lives.
Children who undergo trauma become unsure that they are safe and protected in this world, and become frightened that they have no say-so in any danger that approaches them.
Specific trauma – emotional, physical and sexual abuse, accidents and debilitating illnesses, death, divorce, or any other intensely painful experience – can injure boundary development.
The heart of God seems to beat especially close to the victim of trauma – “He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted.” Isa. 61:1
God desires for the wounds of the traumatized to be bound up by loving people.
g. Our own character traits: 
We contribute by our own individual character styles. For example, some people with a constitutionally greater amount of aggression deal with boundary problems more confrontationally. And some with less aggression shy away from boundaries.
h. Our own sinfulness:
We also contribute to our own boundary development problems by our own depravity. Depravity is our resistance to being creatures under God, our resistance to humility.
