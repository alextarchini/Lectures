         1. "WHAT DOES A BOUNDARY LOOK LIKE?": 
         <!-- start-->
	<p>BOUNDARIES &ndash; Connect Group FEB to MAR 2021</p>

<p>I. What are boundaries? And what does a boundary look like?</p>

<p>Gen 1:28 &ldquo;Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Made in the image of God, we were created to take responsibility for certain tasks. Part of taking responsibility, or ownership, is knowing what our job is, and what is not.</p>

<p>Any confusion of responsibility or ownership in our lives is a problem of boundaries. We need to set mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual boundaries for our lives to help us distinguish what is our responsibility and what is not.</p>

<p>Many sincere, dedicated believers struggle with tremendous confusion about when it is biblically appropriate to set limits. Have you ever asked yourself the following questions?</p>

<p>1. Can I set limits and still be a loving person?</p>

<p>2. What are legitimate boundaries?</p>

<p>3. What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries?</p>

<p>4. How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money?</p>

<p>5. Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries?</p>

<p>6. How do boundaries relate to mutual submission within marriage?</p>

<p>7. Aren&rsquo;t boundaries selfish?</p>

<p>Physical boundaries are easy to see &ndash; stop signs, property lines, fences, walls, etc. Spiritual boundaries are just as real but harder to see. This first chapter is to help you define your boundaries.</p>

<p>A. Me and not Me</p>

<p>A boundary shows me where I end and where another begins. Knowing what I am to own and take responsibility for gives me freedom. Taking responsibility for my life opens up many different options.</p>

<p>Prov 14:10 &ldquo;Each heart knows its own bitterness, and no one else can share its joys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have the responsibility to deal with what is in our soul. The Bible tells us clearly what our parameters are and how to protect them. In addition to showing us what we are responsible for, boundaries help us define what is not our responsibility. Nowhere are we commanded to have &ldquo;over-control&rdquo;.</p>

<p>B. To and For</p>

<p>We are responsible TO others and FOR ourselves.</p>

<p>Gal 6:2 &ldquo;Carry each other&rsquo;s burdens, and in this way, you will fulfill the law of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Denying ourselves to do for others what they CANNOT do for themselves is showing the sacrificial love of Christ. This is being responsible TO.</p>

<p>Gal 6:5 &ldquo;each one should carry their own load.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one can do certain things FOR us. We have to carry/take responsibility for certain aspects of our lives that are our own &ldquo;load&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Problems arise when people act as if their &ldquo;boulders&rdquo; are daily loads and refuse help, or as if their &ldquo;daily loads&rdquo; are boulders they shouldn&rsquo;t have to carry.</p>

<p>C. Good in, Bad out</p>

<p>Boundaries help is to distinguish our property so that we can take care of it. We need to keep things that will nurture us inside our fences and keep things that will harm us outside.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have the bad on the inside and good on the outside. In this case, we need to be able to open up our boundaries to let the good in and the bad out. Our fences need gates in them.</p>

<p>Some of us have pain or sin within, and we need to open up and communicate with God and others about this, so that we can be healed.</p>

<p>James 5:16a &ldquo;Therefore confess your sons to one another [your false steps, your offenses], and pray for one another, that you may be healed and restored.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of us need to open up our gates and allow Jesus and His truth in. Also, other people have good things to give us and we need to learn to open our hearts to them. 2 Cor 6:11-13</p>

<p>D. God and boundaries</p>

<p>The concept of boundaries comes from the very nature of God. He defines Himself as a distinct, separate being, and He is responsible for Himself. He tells us what He thinks, feels, plans, allows, will not allow, likes and dislikes. He tells us who He is and is not.</p>

<p>God also confronts what He will not allow in His yard. He confronts sin and allows consequences for behavior.</p>

<p>E. Examples of boundaries</p>

<p>a. SKIN</p>

<p>The skin boundary keeps the good in and the bad out. It protects your blood and bones and keeps germs outside protecting you from infection.</p>

<p>b. WORDS</p>

<p>You can create good protective fences with your words. The most basic boundary-setting word is no. It lets others know that you exist apart from them and that you are in control of you. Being clear about your no &ndash; and your yes &ndash; is a theme that runs throughout the Bible.</p>

<p>People who have difficulty saying no, struggle with saying no to the control, pressure, demands, and sometimes real needs of others. They feel that if they say no to someone, they will endanger their relationship with that person, so they passively comply and inwardly resent. Sometimes the pressure comes from a person pressuring you to do something, sometimes it comes from our own sense of what we &ldquo;should&rdquo; do.</p>

<p>It is difficult for people to know where you stand when we do not use words to define our property. God shows us the example when he says: &ldquo;I like this, and I hate that.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;I will do this, and I will not do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>c. TRUTH</p>

<p>There is always safety in truth, whether it is knowing God&rsquo;s truth or the truth about ourselves. When we are in touch with God&rsquo;s truth, we are in touch with reality. Honesty about who we are gives us the biblical value of integrity, or oneness.</p>

<p>d. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE</p>

<p>Prov 22:3 &ldquo;the prudent see danger and take refuge;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes physically removing oneself from a situation will help maintain boundaries. It can be to replenish yourself as Jesus did when he left the crowds and retired by Himself. Or it can be to remove yourself from an abusive situation, to get away from danger.</p>

<p>e. TIME</p>

<p>Taking time off from a person or a project can be a way to take back your responsibility over some out-of-control aspects in your life. Adult children, for example, may need to spend some time building boundaries in order to create new ways to relate to their parents, since they have outgrown the old ways of relating. This can often lead to an improvement of the relationship between the children and their parents.</p>

<p>f. EMOTIONAL DISTANCE</p>

<p>This is a temporary boundary to allow space for your heart to heal. We should not continue to set ourselves up for hurt and disappointment. Many of us can be too quick to trust someone in the name of forgiveness and not make sure that the other is producing &ldquo;fruit in keeping with repentance&rdquo;. (Luke 3:8) It is good to forgive and it is also good to guard your heart.</p>

<p>g. OTHER PEOPLE</p>

<p>Other people are necessary to help us set and keep boundaries. Fear of being alone can keep many in hurtful patterns for years, being too afraid that if they set boundaries, they will not have love in their lives.</p>

<p>Also, many people have been taught by their church or their family that boundaries are unbiblical, mean, or selfish. This will be covered in a later chapter. But we need others to give us new input and teaching about biblical truth concerning boundaries.</p>

<p>Creating boundaries always involves a support system.</p>

<p>h. CONSEQUENCES</p>

<p>Just as the Bible sets consequences for certain behaviors, we also need to back up our boundaries with consequences.</p>

<p>2 Thess 3:10 &ldquo;if anyone will not work, don&rsquo;t let him/her eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>God does not enable irresponsible behavior. Consequences give some &ldquo;barbs&rdquo; to fences. They let people know the seriousness of the trespass and the seriousness of our respect for ourselves.</p>

<p>F. What is within my boundaries</p>

<p>a. FEELINGS</p>

<p>Feelings are not always respected for the God given gift they are, especially in the Christian world. They have been called unimportant or fleshly. But they play a huge role in our motivation and behavior.</p>

<p>Feelings should neither be ignored nor placed in charge. The Bible says to &ldquo;own&rdquo; our feelings and be aware of them. Feelings come from the heart and can tell you the state of your relationships.</p>

<p>Our feelings are our responsibility, and we must own them and see them as our problem, so we can begin to find an answer to whatever issue they are pointing to.</p>

<p>b. ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS</p>

<p>Attitudes are the stance you take towards others or something.</p>

<p>Beliefs are anything you accept as true.</p>

<p>We need to own our attitudes and convictions/beliefs because they fall within our property line. We are the ones who feel their effect and we are the only ones who can change them.</p>

<p>Those of us with boundary problems usually have a distorted attitude toward responsibility. We think that to hold people accountable for their feelings, choices, and behaviors is mean.</p>

<p>Prov 13: 18, 24</p>

<p>c. BEHAVIORS</p>

<p>Behaviors have consequences.</p>

<p>Gal 6:7 &ldquo;A man reaps what he sows&rdquo;</p>

<p>To rescue people from the natural consequences of their behavior is to render them powerless.</p>

<p>d. CHOICES</p>

<p>We need to take responsibility for our choices. This leads to the fruit of &ldquo;self-control&rdquo;. We need to realize that we are in control of our choices, no matter how we feel.</p>

<p>Making choices/decisions based on other&rsquo;s approval or on guilt breeds resentment.</p>

<p>Setting boundaries inevitably involves taking responsibility for our choices. We are the ones who make them. We are the ones who must live with their consequences. And we are the ones who may be keeping ourselves from making the choices we could be happy with.</p>

<p>e. VALUES</p>

<p>What we value is what we love and assign importance to.</p>

<p>We often get caught up in valuing the approval of man more than of God.</p>

<p>Boundaries help us not to deny but to own our old hurtful values so God can change them.</p>

<p>f. LIMITS</p>

<p>First the truth is that we do not have the power to set limits on others. What we can do is set limits on our own exposure to people who are not good for us.</p>

<p>God models this for us. He sets standards, but He lets people be who they are and then separates Himself from them when they misbehave, saying: &ldquo;You can be that way if you choose, but you cannot come into my house.&rdquo; Heaven is a place for the repentant and all are welcome.</p>

<p>What we need to learn is to say no to ourselves. We need to allow ourselves to have feelings, impulses, or desires but with self-control/without acting them out.</p>

<p>g. RESSOURCES AND GIFTS</p>

<p>Our talents, given to us by God, are our responsibility. Yet taking ownership of them can often be frightening. It takes work, practice, learning, and grace to overcome the fear of failure that the &ldquo;wicked and lazy&rdquo; servant gave in to (see Matt 25:23, 26-28). If we do not confront our fear, we deny God and insult both His giving of the gift and His grace to sustain us as we are learning.</p>

<p>h. THOUGHTS</p>

<p>Establishing boundaries in our thinking involves 3 things</p>

<p>a.i. We must own our own thoughts: We need to weigh the things we hear from other people. We need to examine if we are thinking our own thoughts or if we have accepted thoughts of others. We should never &ldquo;give our minds&rdquo; to someone else. We are to weigh things for ourselves in the context of relationship, sharpening each other as iron, but remaining separate thinkers.</p>

<p>a.ii. We must grow in knowledge and expand our minds: we do this by studying God&rsquo;s word. We also learn about God through His creation. By learning about His world, we obey the commandment to &ldquo;rule over&rdquo; the earth and all that is within it.</p>

<p>a.iii. We must clarify distorted thinking: we need to ask God to show us people in our lives as they really are. Taking ownership in relationships requires being active in checking out where we may be wrong. We also need to make sure to communicate our thoughts to others. &ldquo;For who knows a person&rsquo;s thoughts except their spirit within them.&rdquo; (1 Cor 2:11) We have our own thoughts, and if we want others to know them, we must tell them.</p>

<p>i. DESIRES</p>

<p>Our desires are our responsibility. We all have different desires and wants, dreams and wishes, goals and plans, hungers and thirsts.</p>

<p>Many desires can masquerade as the real thing. Sometimes our desire for love and affection can be masquerading as sexual desires.</p>

<p>God is interested in our desires, he made them. And like a good Father, He wants to give us what we truly need. But we don&rsquo;t always truly know what that is. We need to come to Him to figure that out.</p>

<p>j. LOVE</p>

<p>Our ability to give and respond to love is our greatest gift. The heart that God fashioned in His image is the center of our being.</p>

<p>Our loving heart, like our physical one, needs an inflow as well as an outflow of lifeblood. It is a trust muscle.</p>

<p>Many of us do not take ownership for how we resist love. We have a lot of love around us, but we do not realize that our loneliness is a result of our own lack of responsiveness. We have a responsibility to respond. We need to claim our hearts as our property and work on our weaknesses in that area.</p>

<p>Questions to work on:</p>

<p>Are there relationships in your life that lack boundaries? That feel unsafe? That are too demanding?</p>

<p>What problems have you taken on that God never asked you to take on? What motivated you to take them on?</p>

<p>What do you want to gain from this study on boundaries?</p>

<p>Looking at each example of boundaries:</p>

<p>Think of an example when people honored that boundary, and consider what hinders you from keeping each boundary strong?</p>

<p>What boundary set up by another person do you need to do a better job honoring?</p>

<p>Why do you have a hard time honoring certain boundaries in other people?</p>

<p>Looking at what is within your boundaries:</p>

<p>In which area are doing a good job taking responsibility?</p>

<p>In what area will you start working on taking more responsibility this week? What will you do? (be specific)</p>

            2. UNDERSTANDING BOUNDARIES: 
<!-- start -->
	<p>BOUNDARIES &ndash; Connect Group FEB to MAR 2021</p>

<p>II. Understanding boundaries</p>

<p>It is easy to misunderstand boundaries. At first glance, it seems as if the individual who has difficulty setting limits is the one who has the boundary problem; however, people who do not respect other&rsquo;s limits also have boundary problems.</p>

<p>This summary categorizes the main types of boundary problems. Boundary conflicts are not limited to those who &ldquo;can&rsquo;t say no&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Four types of boundary problems</p>

<p>1. Compliants: saying YES to the bad</p>

<p>Compliant people have fuzzy and indistinct boundaries, they melt into the demands and needs of other people.</p>

<p>When parents teach children that setting boundaries or saying no is bad, they are teaching them that others can do with them as they wish. Blocking a child&rsquo;s ability to say No handicaps that child for life.</p>

<p>Compliants minimize their differences with others so as not to rock the boat. The inability to say no to the bad is pervasive, it keeps them from refusing evil in their lives and often even from recognizing evil. Compliant people are chameleons.</p>

<p>Here are a couple reasons why some are Compliants:</p>

<p>Fear of hurting others&rsquo; feelings</p>

<p>Fear of abandonment and separateness</p>

<p>A wish to be totally dependent on another</p>

<p>Fear of someone else&rsquo;s anger</p>

<p>Fear of punishment</p>

<p>Fear of being shamed</p>

<p>Fear of being seen as selfish or bad</p>

<p>Fear of being unspiritual</p>

<p>Fear of one&rsquo;s own overstrict, critical conscience (guilty feelings &ndash; condemning oneself for things God Himself does not condemn us for)</p>

<p>2. Avoidants: saying NO to the good</p>

<p>Avoidance is the inability to ask for help, to recognize one&rsquo;s own needs and to let others in. Avoidants withdraw when they are in need; they do not ask for the support of others.</p>

<p>Boundaries are supposed to be able to &ldquo;breathe&rdquo;, to be like fences with a gate that can let the good in and the bad out.</p>

<p>Avoidants confuse boundaries for walls. Individuals with walls for boundaries can let in neither bad nor good. No one touches them.</p>

<p>God designed our personal boundaries to have gates. He designed us to enjoy safe relationships and avoid destructive ones. God even allows us the freedom to let him in or to close him off.</p>

<p>3. Controllers: not respecting others&rsquo; boundaries</p>

<p>Controllers can&rsquo;t respect other people&rsquo;s limits. They resist taking responsibility of their own lives, so they need to control other people&rsquo;s lives. They are perceived as bullies, manipulative and aggressive.</p>

<p>There are two types:</p>

<p>Manipulative controllers: they try to persuade people out of their boundaries, they talk others into saying YES. They use guilt messages, manipulate circumstances and seduce others into carrying their burdens. (Example: Isaac&rsquo;s son Jacob &ndash; Gen. 25:29-34 and Gen. 27:1-29)</p>

<p>Only when the manipulative controller is confronted with their dishonesty can they take responsibility for it, repent of it, and accept their and other&rsquo;s limits. (only after Jacob wrestled with God did he confront his manipulative boundary-lessness Gen. 32:24-32)</p>

<p>Aggressive controllers: they don&rsquo;t listen to or respect other people&rsquo;s boundaries. They run over other people&rsquo;s fences like a tank. They are sometimes verbally abusive and sometimes physically abusive, but most of the time they simply aren&rsquo;t aware that others even have boundaries. They neglect their own responsibility to accept others as they are.</p>

<p>(Peter is an example of an aggressive controller. Peter did not want to accept Jesus&rsquo; boundaries. Jesus immediately confronted Peter&rsquo;s violation of his boundaries. Mark 8:33)</p>

<p>Controllers are undisciplined people. They do a lot of damage to other people, but they themselves have boundary problems as well. Undisciplined they have little ability to delay gratification.</p>

<p>They are limited in their ability to take responsibility for owning their lives. They desperately need to learn to listen to the boundaries of others to help them observe their own.</p>

<p>Finally, controllers are isolated. They rarely feel loved because the people around them are there out of fear, guilt or dependency. At some deep level, controllers are aware of their isolation. (&ldquo;There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear.&rdquo; 1 John 4:18)</p>

<p>4. Non-responsive: not hearing the needs of others</p>

<p>While we should not take on the responsibility of others&rsquo; feelings, attitudes, and behaviors, we do have certain responsibilities to each other.</p>

<p>Non-responsives struggle with paying attention to the responsibilities of love. That is the opposite of what Prov. 3:27 or Rom. 12:18 exhorts us to do.</p>

<p>A key phrase here is &ldquo;in your power&rdquo; or &ldquo;so far as it depends on you&rdquo;. We can&rsquo;t bring peace to someone who doesn&rsquo;t accept it.</p>

<p>There are 2 groups:</p>

<p>- Those with a critical spirit toward others&rsquo; needs.</p>

<p>- Those who are so absorbed in their own desires and needs that they exclude others (a form of narcissism)</p>

<p>How Boundaries are Developped</p>

<p>A. Boundary development</p>

<p>Boundaries aren&rsquo;t inherited, they are built! God&rsquo;s desire is for you to know the wounds of your past. The past is your ally in repairing your present and ensuring a better future.</p>

<p>To be the truth-telling, responsible, free, and loving people God wants us to be, we need to learn limits in childhood, when our character is being formed. Good parenting helps children reach that goal (Prov 22:6). Good parenting is being a partner in helping young ones discover what God intended for them to be and helping them reach that goal.</p>

<p>B. Bonding: the foundation of boundary building</p>

<p>A basic need for boundary building is deep, abiding relationships with people who will love you no matter what. We cannot develop or set boundaries apart from supporting relationships with God and others.</p>

<p>Our deepest need is to belong, to be in a relationship, to have a spiritual and emotional &ldquo;home&rdquo;. It is the very nature of God to be in a relationship. The apostle John writes &ldquo;God is love&rdquo; and love means relationship &ndash; the caring, committed connection of one individual to another. (1 John 4:16) Like God, our most central need is to be connected.</p>

<p>We are built for relationship. Attachment is the foundation of the soul&rsquo;s existence. When this foundation is cracked, boundaries become impossible to develop. Because we lack relationship, we have nowhere to go in a conflict. We live in a vacuum. When we are not secure that we are loved, we are forced to choose between 2 bad options: setting limits at the risk of losing a relationship, or not setting limits and remaining a prisoner to the wishes of another person.</p>

<p>When infants successfully complete the first development task &ndash; that of bonding with Mom and Dad- they gain the security that comes with knowing they are loved. They develop an internal sense of belonging and safety even away from the presence of their mother. As children learn to feel safe and at home with their primary relationship, they are building good foundations to withstand the separateness and conflict that come with boundary development. It is God&rsquo;s plan for us to be loved enough by him and others so that we do not feel isolated even when we are alone.</p>

<p>C. Separation and individuation: the construction of the soul</p>

<p>As infants gain a sense of internal safety and attachment, a second need arises. The baby&rsquo;s need for autonomy, or independence, starts to emerge.</p>

<p>- Separation: perceiving himself or herself as distinct from Mother, a &ldquo;not me&rdquo; experience</p>

<p>- Individuation: developing an identity, a &ldquo;me&rdquo; experience</p>

<p>One must first determine who they are not before they can discover the true, authentic-aspects of their God-given identity.</p>

<p>Luke 2:41-49</p>

<p>In this biblical passage, the only one recorded from Jesus boyhood, we see a young man who knows who he is and who he is not. He has separated from his folks and individuated in his values, thoughts, and opinions. Three phases are critical to this kind of separation and individualization and to the development of healthy boundaries in childhood: hatching, practicing, and rapprochement.</p>

<p>- Hatching &ldquo;Mommy and I are not the same.&rdquo;: a time of exploration, of touching, of tasting and feeling new things.</p>

<p>- Practicing &ldquo;I can do Anything!&rdquo; (10 m to 18m): I can do anything &ndash; toddlers feel exhilaration and energy, with no impulse control, no boundaries on their passions.</p>

<p>The difference between hatching and practicing is radical. The hatching baby is overwhelmed by this new world and still leans a great deal on Mother, the practicing child is trying to leave her behind!</p>

<p>In the practicing phase, children learn that aggressiveness and taking initiative are good.</p>

<p>- Rapprochement &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do Everything.&rdquo; (18 m to 3 years): a restoration of harmonious relations. The connection with the Mother is important again but the child brings a more separate self into the relationship.</p>

<p>Typically, this is a difficult period &ndash; toddlers at this stage are temperamental, oppositional, and angry.</p>

<p>Here are some tools toddlers will use to build boundaries:</p>

<p> - Anger: It was created by God for a purpose &ndash; to tell us that there is a problem that needs to be confronted.</p>

<p> - Ownership: Being created in God&rsquo;s image also means having ownership, or stewardship. Me, My, Mine are not swear words but they must be applied in the correct way. Without a &ldquo;mine&rdquo;, we have no sense of responsibility to develop, nurture, and protect these resources. With good parenting, they will learn sacrifice and develop a giving, loving heart, but not until they have a personality that has been loved enough to give love away (1 John 4:19)</p>

<p> - No. The one-word boundary: Saying no gives them the power to make choices. It protects them. It is the first verbal boundary children learn. Though they can&rsquo;t make all the choices they&rsquo;d like, young children should be able to have a no that is listened to. Children also need to be able not only to give a no but also take a no.</p>

<p>Two additional periods of life focus on boundary building:</p>

<p> - The adolescent years are a reenactment of the first years of life.</p>

<p> - Young adulthood is the time when children leave home or college and start a career and/or get married.</p>

<p>The earlier the child learns good boundaries, the less turmoil he or she experiences later in life.</p>

<p>D. Boundary injuries &ndash; what goes wrong?</p>

<p>Generally, the earlier and more severe the injury, the deeper the boundary problem.</p>

<p>a. Withdrawal from boundaries:</p>

<p>Good relationships are built on the freedom to refuse and confront. Prov. 27:17</p>

<p>Parental limits are crucial. Parents need to stay attached and connected to their children even when they disagree with them. They can get angry, but they should not withdraw. It is crucial that kid&rsquo;s disagreement, their practices, their experimentation do not result in a withdrawal of love.</p>

<p>b. Hostility against boundaries:</p>

<p>If the parents show hostility, the children do not learn that delayed gratification and being responsible have benefits. They only learn how to avoid someone&rsquo;s wrath.</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s discipline teaches, it does not punish. (Heb 12:10-11)</p>

<p>c. Overcontrol:</p>

<p>It occurs when otherwise loving parents try to protect their children from making mistakes by having too strict rules and limits. The problem with overcontrol is that while a major responsibility of good parents is to control and protect, they must make room for children to make mistakes.</p>

<p>d. Lack of limits:</p>

<p>It is the opposite of hostility, but the resulting injuries can be just as severe. Ultimately no one can really escape the disciplines of life. We always reap what we sow.</p>

<p>e. Inconsistent limits:</p>

<p>Sometimes, due to their confusion about rearing children of their own injuries, some parents combine strict and lax limits, sending conflicting messages to children. Alcoholic families often exhibit inconsistent limits.</p>

<p>f. Trauma:</p>

<p>A trauma is an intensely painful emotional experience rather than a character pattern. A trauma can affect boundary development because it shakes up two necessary foundations to children&rsquo;s growth (i) the world is reasonably safe, and (ii) they have control over their lives.</p>

<p>Children who undergo trauma become unsure that they are safe and protected in this world, and become frightened that they have no say-so in any danger that approaches them.</p>

<p>Specific trauma &ndash; emotional, physical and sexual abuse, accidents and debilitating illnesses, death, divorce, or any other intensely painful experience &ndash; can injure boundary development.</p>

<p>The heart of God seems to beat especially close to the victim of trauma &ndash; &ldquo;He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted.&rdquo; Isa. 61:1</p>

<p>God desires for the wounds of the traumatized to be bound up by loving people.</p>

<p>g. Our own character traits:</p>

<p>We contribute by our own individual character styles. For example, some people with a constitutionally greater amount of aggression deal with boundary problems more confrontationally. And some with less aggression shy away from boundaries.</p>

<p>h. Our own sinfulness:</p>

<p>We also contribute to our own boundary development problems by our own depravity. Depravity is our resistance to being creatures under God, our resistance to humility.</p>

<p>Questions</p>

<p>i. As you were growing up, what did you learn about setting boundaries and saying no? Were those things good or bad?</p>

<p>ii. Do you condemn yourself for things that God does not condemn you for? Example?</p>

<p>iii. Are your boundaries more like walls than fences? Explain.</p>

<p>iv. In what situations have you been perceived as a controller? Why was it important for you to have control in that situation?</p>

<p>v. In which quadrant do you see yourself?</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t Say</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t Hear</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>Compliants: feel guilty and/or controlled by others; cannot set boundaries.</p>

<p>Controllers: aggressively or manipulatively violate others&rsquo; boundaries</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>Non-responsives: set boundaries against the responsibility of love</p>

<p>Avoidants: set boundaries against receiving care of others</p>

<p>BOUNDARIES &ndash; Connect Group FEB to MAR 2021</p>

<p>III. The Ten Laws of Boundaries &ndash; What the Bible says about boundaries.</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s world is set up with laws and principles. Spiritual realities are as real as gravity, and if you do not know them, you will discover their effects. Just because we have not been taught these principles of life and relationships does not mean they will not rule.</p>

<p>A. Law 1: The Law of Sowing and Reaping</p>

<p>The law of cause and effect is a basic law of life.</p>

<p>Gal. 6:7-8</p>

<p>When God tells us that we will reap what we sow, he is not punishing us; he is telling us how things really are.</p>

<p>- If you smoke cigarettes, you may get lung cancer</p>

<p>- If you overspend, you may have to deal with creditors</p>

<p>- If you eat right and exercise, you may have fewer health issues</p>

<p>- If you budget wisely, you may be able to pay your bills</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, people do not reap what they sow, because someone else steps in and reaps the consequences for them.</p>

<p>Just as we can interfere with the law of gravity by catching a glass tumbling off the table, people can interfere with the Law of Cause and Effect by stepping in and rescuing irresponsible people. Rescuing a person from the natural consequences of their behavior enables them to continue in irresponsible behavior. The Law is still at work, but the doer is not suffering the consequences; someone else is.</p>

<p>Today we call a person who continually rescues another person a codependent.</p>

<p>Establishing boundaries helps codependent people stop interrupting the Law of Sowing and Reaping in their loved one&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>Simply confronting is not enough: confronting an irresponsible person is not painful to them; only consequences are.</p>

<p>Codependent people bring insults and pain on themselves when they confront irresponsible people. In reality, they just need to stop interrupting the Law of Sowing and Reaping in someone&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>B. Law 2: The Law of Responsibility</p>

<p>Have you ever heard someone say: &ldquo;Setting boundaries is so self-centered. We should love one another and deny ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is an unbiblical view on boundaries.</p>

<p>The law of responsibility includes loving others. John 15:12 and Gal. 5:13-14</p>

<p>Problems arise when boundaries of responsibility are confused. We are to love one another, not be one another. In short, I cannot grow for you; only you can. In the same way, you cannot grow for me. You are responsible for yourself and I am responsible for myself. Phil. 2:12-13</p>

<p>An important aspect of being responsible &ldquo;to&rdquo; is not only in the giving but in the setting of limits on another&rsquo;s destructive and irresponsible behavior.</p>

<p>C. Law 3: The Law of Power</p>

<p>Am I powerless over my behavior? If I am, how can I become responsible? What DO I have the power to do?</p>

<p>In Rom. 7:15, 19, 23, Paul confesses his powerlessness.</p>

<p>John says that we are all in that state, and anyone who denies it is lying &ndash; 1 John 1:8</p>

<p>Though you do not have the power in and of yourself to overcome addictions or patterns of behavior, you do have the power to do some things that will bring fruits of victory later.</p>

<p>a) You have the power to agree with the truth about your problems. This is called &ldquo;confession&rdquo;, which means to &ldquo;agree with&rdquo;.</p>

<p>b) You have the power to submit your inability to God. You may not be able to make yourself well, but you can call the doctor! (1 John 1:9; James 4:7-10; Matt. 5:3, 6)</p>

<p>c) You have the power to search and ask God and others to reveal more and more about what is within your boundaries.</p>

<p>d) You have the power to turn from the evil that you find within you. This is called &ldquo;repentance&rdquo;, which means you can see your sinful parts as aspects that you want to change.</p>

<p>e) You have the power to humble yourself and ask God and others to help you with your developmental injuries and leftover childhood needs.</p>

<p>f) You have the power to seek out those whom you have injured and make amends. Matt. 5:23-24</p>

<p>Serenity Prayer (probably the best boundary prayer ever written)</p>

<p>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,</p>

<p>the courage to change the things I can,</p>

<p>and the wisdom to know the difference.</p>

<p>You can work on submitting yourself to the process and working with God to change you. You cannot change anything else: not the weather, the past, the economy &ndash; and especially not other people.</p>

<p>You cannot change others.</p>

<p>What you can do is influence others. But there is a trick. Since you cannot get them to change, you must change yourself so that their destructive patterns no longer work on you. So, pray for the wisdom to know the difference between what you have the power to change and what you do not.</p>

<p>D. Law 4: The Law of Respect</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t accept me if I say no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they will get angry if I set limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t speak to me for a week if I tell them how I feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We fear that others will not respect our boundaries.</p>

<p>Sometimes the problem is that we judge the boundary decisions of others, thinking that we know best how they &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to give&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could they refuse to come by and pick me up? It is right on their way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so selfish of her not to come to the church gathering. After all, the rest of us are sacrificing our time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems that, after all I do for you, you could at least do me this one little favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is where the law of respect comes in. As Jesus said, &ldquo;So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you&rdquo; (Matt. 7:12)</p>

<p>We need to love the boundaries of others to command respect for our own.</p>

<p>Freedom begets freedom.</p>

<p>When we accept others&rsquo; freedom, we do not get angry, feel guilty, or withdraw our love when they set boundaries with us. When we accept others&rsquo; freedom, we feel better about our own.</p>

<p>E. Law 5: The Law of Motivation</p>

<p>The Bible says that true love leads to a blessed state and a state of cheer. Love brings happiness, not depression. If your loving is depressing you, it is probably not true love.</p>

<p>Some of us learn early in life that if we did not do what our parent wanted; they would withdraw their love from us. We then learn to fear angry confrontations, and this fear keep us from saying no to others.</p>

<p>a. Fear of loss of love, or abandonment</p>

<p>People who say yes and then resent saying yes fear losing someone&rsquo;s love. They give to get love, and when they do not get it, they feel abandoned.</p>

<p>b. Fear of others&rsquo; anger</p>

<p>Because of old hurts and poor boundaries, some people cannot stand for anyone to be mad at them.</p>

<p>c. Fear of loneliness</p>

<p>Some people give in to others because they feel that that will &ldquo;win&rdquo; love and end their loneliness.</p>

<p>d. Fear of losing the &ldquo;good me&rdquo; inside</p>

<p>We are made to love. As a result, those who have this fear, when they are not loving, they are in pain. Many people cannot say, &ldquo;I love you and I do not want to do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>e. Guilt</p>

<p>Many people&rsquo;s giving is motivated by guilt. When they say no, they feel bad. So, they keep trying to earn a sense of goodness.</p>

<p>f. Payback</p>

<p>Many people have received things with guilt messages attached &ndash; &ldquo;I never had it as good as you.&rdquo; &ldquo;You should be ashamed of all you get&rdquo;. They feel a burden to pay for all they have been given.</p>

<p>g. Approval</p>

<p>Many feel as if they are still children seeking parental approval. Therefore, when someone wants something from them, they need to give so that this symbolic parent will be &ldquo;well pleased&rdquo;.</p>

<p>h. Over-identification with others&rsquo; loss</p>

<p>Many times, people have not dealt with all their disappointments and losses, so whenever they deprive someone else with a no, they &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the other person&rsquo;s sadness to the nth degree. They cannot stand to hurt somebody that badly, so they comply.</p>

<p>F. Law 6: The Law of Evaluation</p>

<p>We need to evaluate the effects of setting boundaries and be responsible to the other person, but that does not mean we should avoid setting boundaries because someone responds with hurt or anger. To have boundaries is to live a purposeful life.</p>

<p>Jesus refers to it as the &ldquo;narrow gate&rdquo;. Only the honest, purposeful life leads to good fruit. Deciding to set boundaries is difficult because it requires decision making and confrontation, which, in turn, may cause pain to someone you love.</p>

<p>We need to evaluate the pain caused by our making choices and empathize with it.</p>

<p>Example: A child chooses to go skiing with friends rather than coming home for Christmas. The child&rsquo;s choice may cause their parents sadness, but they are not harmed. A loving response from the child toward their parent&rsquo;s expression of sadness at the news would be, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sad that we won&rsquo;t be together too. I&rsquo;m looking forward to coming home over the summer.&rdquo; If the parents are respectful of their child&rsquo;s freedom to make choices, their response would sound something like this, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed that you are not coming home for Christmas, but I hope you will have a great time with your friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We cause pain by making choices that others do not like, but we also cause pain by confronting people when they are wrong. By if we do not share our anger with another, bitterness and hatred can set in. (Eph. 4:25)</p>

<p>As iron sharpens iron, we need confrontation and truth from others to grow.</p>

<p>G. Law 7: The Law of Proactivity</p>

<p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Paul says that wrath and sinful passions are a direct reaction to the severity of the law (Rom. 4:15; 5:20; 7:5). In Ephesians and Colossians, he says that wrath and disillusionment can be reactions to parental injustice (Eph. 6:4; Col. 3:21).</p>

<p>Sometimes people when they start seeing a counselor/therapist, after complying for years, may react all the sudden very explosively. It is due to all their pent-up rage coming to the surface. This reactive phase of boundary creation is helpful, especially for victims. They need to get out of the powerless, victimized place in which they may have been forced by physical and sexual abuse, or by emotional blackmail and manipulation. We should herald their emancipation.</p>

<p>Reaction phases are necessary but not sufficient for the establishment of boundaries. Eventually, you must rejoin the human race you have reacted to, and establish connections as equals, loving your neighbor as yourself. This is the beginning of the establishment of proactive instead of reactive boundaries.</p>

<p>Proactive people should you what they love, what they want, what they purpose, and what they stand for. Proactive people are able to &ldquo;love others as themselves&rdquo;. They have mutual respect. They can &ldquo;die to self&rdquo; and not &ldquo;return evil for evil&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Spiritual adulthood has higher goals than &ldquo;finding yourself&rdquo;. A reactive stage is a stage, not an identity. It is necessary but not sufficient.</p>

<p>H. Law 8: The Law of Envy</p>

<p>James 4:2 &ldquo;You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Envy is probably the basest emotion we have.</p>

<p>Envy defines &ldquo;good&rdquo; as &ldquo;what I do not possess&rdquo; and hates the good that it has.</p>

<p>Envy is a self-perpetuating cycle. Boundaryless people feel empty and unfulfilled. They look at another&rsquo;s sense of fullness and feel envious. This time and energy need to be spent on taking responsibility for their lack and doing something about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not because you ask not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Possessions and accomplishments are not the only things we envy. We can envy a person&rsquo;s character and personality instead of developing the gifts God has given us. (Rom. 12:6)</p>

<p>Scenarios &ndash; part 1:</p>

<p>A lonely man stays isolated and envious of the close relationships&rsquo; others have.</p>

<p>A single woman withdraws from social life, envying the marriages and families of her friends.</p>

<p>A middle-aged woman feels stuck in her career and wants to pursue something she would enjoy, yet she always has a &ldquo;yes, but&#8230;&rdquo; reason why she can&rsquo;t, resenting and envying those who have &ldquo;gone for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man chooses the righteous life but envies and resents those who seem to be &ldquo;having all the fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These people are all negating their own actions and comparing themselves to others (Gal. 4:6), staying stuck and resentful.</p>

<p>Scenarios &ndash; part 2:</p>

<p>A lonely man owns his lack of relationships and asks himself and God, I wonder why I always withdraw from people. I can at least go and talk to a counselor about this. Even if I am afraid of social situations, I could seek some help. No one should live this way. I will make the call.</p>

<p>The single woman asks; I wonder why I never get asked out and why I keep getting turned down for dates. What is wrong about what I am doing or how I am communicating or where I am going to meet people? How could I become a more interesting person? Maybe I could join a therapy group to find out why or could use a dating site to find people with interests similar to mine.</p>

<p>The middle-aged woman asks herself; Why am I reluctant to pursue my interests? Why do I feel selfish when I want to quit my job to do something I enjoy? What am I afraid of? If I were really honest, I would notice that the ones who are doing what they like have had to take risks and sometimes work and go to school to change jobs. That may be more than I am willing to do.</p>

<p>The righteous man asks himself; If I am really &ldquo;choosing&rdquo; to love and serve God, why do I feel like a slave? What is wrong with my spiritual life? What is it about me that envies someone living in the gutter?</p>

<p>These people are questioning themselves instead of envying others.</p>

<p>I. Law 9: The Law of Activity</p>

<p>Human beings are responders and initiators. Many times, we have boundary problems because we lack initiative &ndash; the God-given ability to propel ourselves into life.</p>

<p>The best boundaries are formed when a child is pushing against the world naturally and the outside world sets its limits on the child. In this way the aggressive child learns limits without losing their spirit. Our spiritual and emotional well-being depends on our having this spirit. (Matt. 25:14-30 &ndash; the active and assertive servants were rewarded&#8230;) The sad thing is that many people who are passive are not inherently bad people.</p>

<p>However, evil is an active force, and passivity can become an ally of evil by not pushing against it.</p>

<p>God will match our effort, but he will never do our work for us. (Matt. 25:14-30 &ndash; the &ldquo;wicked and lazy&rdquo; servant was passive)</p>

<p>The sin that God rebukes is not trying and failing but failing to try. (Heb. 10:38-39)</p>

<p>Passive &ldquo;shrinking back&rdquo; is intolerable to God, and when we understand how destructive it is to the soul, we can see why God does not tolerate it. God wants us to &ldquo;preserve our souls.&rdquo; That is the role of boundaries; they define and preserve our property, our soul.</p>

<p>Our boundaries can only be created by our being active and aggressive, by our knocking, seeking, and asking. (Matt. 7:7-8)</p>

<p>J. Law 10: The Law of Exposure</p>

<p>A boundary is a property line. We do not exist in a vacuum. We exist in relation to God and others. Your boundaries define you in relation to others.</p>

<p>The whole concept of boundaries has to do with the fact that we exist in relationship. Therefore, boundaries are really about relationship, and finally about love.</p>

<p>The law of exposure says that your boundaries need to be made visible to others and communicated to them in relationship.</p>

<p>We have many boundary problems because of relational fears &ndash; fears of guilt, not being liked, loss of love, loss of connection, loss of approval, receiving anger, being known, ...</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s plan is that we learn how to love. These relational problems can only be solved in relationships, for that is the context of the problems themselves, and the context of spiritual existence.</p>

<p>Because of our fears, we try to have secret boundaries. We withdraw passively and quietly instead of communicating an honest no to someone we love. We secretly resent instead of telling someone we are angry about how they have hurt us. Often, we will privately endure the pain of someone&rsquo;s irresponsibility instead of telling them how their behavior affects us and other loved ones, information that would be helpful to their soul.</p>

<p>In these instances, because of unexpressed boundaries, the relationships suffered.</p>

<p>An important thing to remember about boundaries is that they exist, and they will affect us, whether we communicate them or not. If our boundaries are not communicated and exposed directly, they will be communicated indirectly or through manipulation.</p>

<p>Eph. 4:25-26 &ldquo;In your anger do not sin: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The biblical mandate is to be honest and be in the light.</p>

<p>The Bible continually speaks of our being in the light and of the light as the only place where we have access to God and others. But because of our fears, we hide aspects of ourselves in the darkness, where the devil has an opportunity.</p>

<p>Healing always takes place in the light. Ps. 51:6 &ldquo;You desire truth in the innermost being, and in the hidden part you will make me know wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>God wants real relationship with us and wants us to have real relationship with each other. Real relationship means that I am in the light with my boundaries and other aspects of myself that are difficult to communicate. Our boundaries are affected by sin; they &ldquo;miss the mark&rdquo; and need to be brought into the light for God to heal them and others to benefit from them. This is the path to real love: Communicate your boundaries openly.</p>

<p>God has probably led you out of captivity also. Whether it was from a dysfunctional family, the world, your own religious self-righteousness, or the scatteredness of being lost, he has been your Redeemer. But what he has secured needs to be possessed. The land to which he has brought you has certain realities and principles. Learn these as set forth in his Word, and you will find his kingdom a wonderful place to live.</p>

<p>Questions to work on:</p>

<p>Which laws had the most to say to you?</p>

<p>How has your understanding of boundaries changed because of this lesson?</p>

<p>What is God saying to you through this lesson on the laws of boundaries?</p>

<p>What have you determined to do because of what you&rsquo;ve learned in this lesson about God&rsquo;s laws, boundaries and yourself?</p>

<p>Prayer</p>

<p>Creator and Redeemer God, thank you for the wondrous universe you&rsquo;ve fashioned and the laws that you&rsquo;ve established for its functioning. Thank you, too, that similar laws exist in the spiritual realm as well and that, through this study, I am learning more about those laws that govern relationships and my well-being. Father God, I see how these laws are rooted in your love, in your gracious, forgiving, and unconditional love. I ask therefore that you open my heart that I might learn these laws, practice them, internalize them, and ultimately find freedom in them, your laws of love. I pray in Jesus&rsquo; name. Amen.</p>

            4. BOUNDARIES &ndash; 
		<!-- start -->
		
<p>IV. Common Boundary Myths</p>

<p>A myth is a fiction that looks like truth.</p>

<p>1. Myth 1: If I set boundaries, I&rsquo;m being selfish.</p>

<p>Christians have a deep-seated fear of being self-centered, interested only in one&rsquo;s own concerns and not those of others. The number one hallmark of Christians is that we love others (John 13: 35) &ndash; Is this self-centeredness? No.</p>

<p>Appropriate Boundaries actually increase our ability to care about others.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between selfishness and stewardship.</p>

<p>- Selfishness has to do with a fixation on our own wishes and desires to the exclusion of our responsibility to love others. Though having wishes and desires is a God-given trait (Prov. 13:4), we are to keep them in line with healthy goals and responsibility.</p>

<p>God is much more interested in meeting our needs than he is granting all our wishes (Phil. 4:12-13; 4:19). At the same time, God does not make our wishes and desires &ldquo;all bad&rdquo; either. He will meet many of them (Psalm 37:4).</p>

<p>Even if we have God&rsquo;s help, it is crucial to understand that meeting our own needs is basically our job (Matt. 7:7); the biblical picture is clear: our lives are our responsibility. (Phil 2:13).</p>

<p> - Stewardship: Just as a store manager takes good care of a shop for the owner, we are to do the same with our souls. If a lack of boundaries causes us to mismanage the store, the owner has the right to be upset with us.</p>

<p>We are to develop our lives, abilities, feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.</p>

<p>When we say no to people and activities that are harmful to us, we are protecting God&rsquo;s investment.</p>

<p>As you can see, there is quite a difference between selfishness and stewardship.</p>

<p>2. Myth 2: Boundaries are a sign of disobedience.</p>

<p>Many Christians fear that setting and keeping limits signals rebellion or disobedience.</p>

<p>The truth is life-changing: a lack of boundaries is often a sign of disobedience.</p>

<p>People who have shaky limits are often compliant on the outside but rebellious and resentful on the inside. (&ldquo;&#8230;thoughts and attitudes of the heart&rdquo; Heb. 4:12)</p>

<p>An internal no nullifies an external yes. (Hos. 6:6)</p>

<p>If we say yes to God or anyone else when we really mean no, we move into a position of compliance. We must always say yes out of a heart of love. (2 Cor. 9:7)</p>

<p>When our motive is fear - of a real person or a guilty conscience &ndash; we love not. And God doesn&rsquo;t want us to obey out of fear, but out of love.</p>

<p>Boundaries can be a sign of disobedience. We can say no to good things for wrong reasons but having that no &ndash; setting that boundary &ndash; helps us clarify, to be honest, and to tell the truth about our motives. Then we can allow God to work in us.</p>

<p>3. Myth 3: If I begin setting boundaries, I will be hurt by others.</p>

<p>Many people genuinely believe in the necessity of boundaries but are terrified of their consequences. It is possible that others will become angry at our boundaries and attack, or worse, withdraw from us. God never gave us the power or the right to control how others respond to our no.</p>

<p>Read the account of Jesus and the rich young man (Matt 19: 16-22)</p>

<p>We cannot manipulate people into swallowing our boundaries by sugarcoating them.</p>

<p>Boundaries are a &ldquo;litmus test&rdquo; for the quality of our relationships. Those people in our lives who can respect our boundaries will love our wills, our opinions, our separateness. Those who can&rsquo;t respect our boundaries are telling us that they don&rsquo;t love our no. They only love our yes, in other words, our compliance.</p>

<p>Setting limits has to do with telling the truth.</p>

<p>First there is the person who welcomes your boundaries, who accepts them, who listens to them, who says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you have a separate opinion. It makes me a better person.&rdquo; This person is called wise, or righteous.</p>

<p>Secondly there is the person who hates limits, who resents your difference, who tries to manipulate you into giving up your treasures.</p>

<p>To differentiate between the two types of people, try the &ldquo;litmus test&rdquo; and tell your significant relationships no in some area. You will either come out with increased intimacy or learn that there was very little intimacy to begin with.</p>

<p>Now it is not wise to immediately alienate yourself from everyone important to you. It is good to remember that we are made for relationship and that we do need people.</p>

<p>It is only from a place of being &ldquo;rooted and grounded in love&rdquo; (Eph. 3:17) that you can safely begin learning to tell the truth. Such bonds enable us to set boundaries. And while some people will abandon or attack us for having boundaries, it is better to know about their character so that we can take steps to fix the problem.</p>

<p>4. Myth 4: If I set boundaries, I will hurt others.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;hurt silence&rdquo; &#8230;</p>

<p>If this is the case, the problem is that you are seeing boundaries as an offensive weapon. Nothing could be further from the truth. Boundaries are a defensive tool.</p>

<p>Appropriate boundaries don&rsquo;t control, attack of hurt anyone. They simply prevent your treasures from being taken at the wrong time. The principle speaks not only to those who would like to control or manipulate us, but it also applies to the legitimate needs of others.</p>

<p>Even when someone has a valid problem, there are times when for some reason we can&rsquo;t sacrifice. Jesus left the multitudes, for example, to be alone with his Father (Matt. 14:22-23). We all need more than God and a best friend. We need a group of supportive relationships because having more than one person in our lives allows our friends to be human, to be busy, to be unavailable at times, to hurt and to have problems of their own, and to have time alone.</p>

<p>This is the beauty behind the Bible&rsquo;s teachings on the church, the body of Christ. We are a group of lumpy, bumpy, unfinished sinners who ask for help and give help, who ask again and give again. And when our supportive network is strong enough, we all help each other mature into what God intended us to be: &ldquo;bearing with one another in love. Mak[ing] every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.&rdquo; (Eph. 4:2-3)</p>

<p>In these supportive relationships, we also learn that other people can tolerate our no. When our supportive network is strong enough, we all help each other mature into what God intended us to be (Eph 4:2-3). And we can accept a no from God. He knows we take responsibility for our lives &ndash; and sometimes a no helps us do just that.</p>

<p>5. Myth 5: Boundaries mean that I&rsquo;m angry.</p>

<p>Quite often, when people being telling the truth, setting limits, and taking responsibility, an &ldquo;angry cloud&rdquo; follows them around for a while. They become touchy and easily offended, and they discover a hair-trigger temper that frighten them.</p>

<p>Boundaries don&rsquo;t cause anger in us. Emotions, or feelings, have a function.</p>

<p>- Fear tells us to move away from danger, to be careful.</p>

<p>- Sadness tells us that we&rsquo;ve lost something, a relationship, an opportunity, or an idea.</p>

<p>- Anger is, like all other emotions, a signal. It signals danger. Instead of withdrawing, anger is a sign that we must move forward to confront the threat. Anger tells us that our boundaries have been violated. It can tell us we are in danger of being injured or controlled. Anger also provides us with a sense of power to solve a problem. It energizes us to protect ourselves, those we love, and our principles.</p>

<p>As with all emotions, anger doesn&rsquo;t understand time. It doesn&rsquo;t dissipate automatically if the danger occurred two minutes ago or 20 years ago!</p>

<p>It must be worked through appropriately. Otherwise, anger simply lives inside the heart. This is why individuals with injured boundaries are often shocked by the rage they feel inside when they begin setting limits. This is generally not &ldquo;new anger&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;old anger&rdquo;. Years of constant boundary violations generate great anger.</p>

<p>As hostile feelings surface bring them to relationship. Confess them. The Bible tells us to tell the truth to each other about our lacks so that we may be healed (James 5:16).</p>

<p>The first step is to experience the grace of God through others who will love you in your anger.</p>

<p>The second step is to rebuild the injured parts of your soul. Take responsibility for healing the &ldquo;treasures&rdquo; that may have been violated. The more we heal, the less anger we feel.</p>

<p>Finally, as you develop a sense of biblical boundaries, you find more safety in the present. You are more confident and less enslaved to your fear of others. As you develop better boundaries, you have less need for anger.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t fear the rage you discover when you first begin developing boundaries. It is the protest of earlier parts of your soul, parts that need to be unveiled, understood, and loved by God and people. Then you need to take responsibility for healing them and developing better boundaries.</p>

<p>Individuals with mature boundaries are the least angry people in the world. Because they prevent boundary violation in the first place, they are more in control of their lives and values and don&rsquo;t need anger.</p>

<p>6. Myth 6: When others set boundaries, it injures me.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at why accepting other&rsquo;s boundaries is such a problem.</p>

<p>First, having inappropriate boundaries set on us can injure us, especially in childhood. A parent can hurt a child by not providing the correct amount of emotional connection at the appropriate time. Children&rsquo;s emotional and psychological needs are primarily the responsibility of the parents.</p>

<p>Second, we project our own injuries onto others. When we feel pain, one response is to &ldquo;disown&rdquo; the bad feeling and to throw it onto others. This is called projection. Sensing their own pain in others, they will avoid setting limits on others, as they imagine how devastating it would be to them.</p>

<p>Third, an inability to receive someone&rsquo;s boundary may mean there is an overdependent relationship. Though we certainly need each other, no one but God is totally indispensable.</p>

<p>When a conflict with one significant person can bring us to despair, it is possible that we are too focused and dependent on that person to meet our needs. Such dependency is appropriate for children, but they are to grow out of this in adulthood and move into having several healthy and supportive relationships.</p>

<p>Ask yourself: &ldquo;If the person I can&rsquo;t hear no from were to die tonight, to whom would I go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to develop several deep, significant relationships. This allows those in our lives to feel free to say no to us without guilt because we have somewhere else to go.</p>

<p>When we have a person we can&rsquo;t take no from, we have, in effect, handed over the control of our lives to them.</p>

<p>Fourth, an inability to accept others&rsquo; boundaries can indicate a problem in taking responsibility. Some people become so accustomed to others rescuing them that they begin to believe that their well-being is someone else&rsquo;s problem.</p>

<p>In 2 Cor. 7:8-9, Paul strongly confronted the Corinthians. They accepted and responded well to Paul&rsquo;s boundaries, whatever they were.</p>

<p>Since being on the receiving end of boundaries is hurtful, we may vow never to hurt someone else by maintaining our boundaries.</p>

<p>In Matthew 7:12, Jesus shares the Golden rule: &ldquo;In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you want others to respect your boundaries, then you must be willing to respect the boundaries of others.</p>

<p>7. Myth 7: Boundaries Cause Feelings of Guilt</p>

<p>One of our major obstacles to setting boundaries with others in our lives is our feelings of obligation. What do we owe not only our parents but anyone who has been loving toward us? What is appropriate and biblical, and what is not? Many individuals solve this dilemma by avoiding setting boundaries with those to whom they feel an obligation.</p>

<p>The idea is that because we have received something, we owe something. However, &ldquo;gift&rdquo; implies no string attached. All that is really needed is gratitude. That is how God views his gift of salvation to us. It cost him his son. It was motivated out of love for us. And our response is to receive it and be grateful.</p>

<p>What do we owe those who are kind to us, who have genuinely cared for us? We owe them thanks.</p>

<p>We need to distinguish here between those who &ldquo;give to get&rdquo; and those who truly give selflessly. It&rsquo;s generally easy to tell the difference. If the giver is hurt or angered by a sincere thanks, the gift was probably a loan. If the gratitude is enough, you probably received a legitimate gift with no feelings of guilt attached.</p>

<p> Sometimes moving on from a church a job or a friend would be a mature move, but feelings of obligation keep us from doing so.</p>

<p>8. Myth 8: Boundaries are permanent, and I&rsquo;m afraid of burning my bridges.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that your no is always subject to you. You own your boundaries; they do not own you. You can always renegotiate the boundary. You can change the boundary if you are in a safer place.</p>

<p>Changing and renegotiating boundaries has many biblical precedents.</p>

<p>- God chose not to destroy Nineveh when the city repented. (Jonah 3:10)</p>

<p>- Paul rejected John Mark for a mission trip because the younger man had deserted Paul (Acts 15:37-39) &ndash; yet, years later, Paul requested John Mark&rsquo;s companionship (2 Tim. 4:11)</p>

<p>As you can see, some of these myths are genuine misconceptions you may have learned from distorted teachings. Yet others simply result from the fear of standing up and saying no to unbiblical responsibility.</p>

<p>Prayerfully review which myths have entangled and ensnared you.</p>

<p>Questions to work on:</p>

<p>How do you define selfishness?</p>

<p>What does Paul say in 2 Cor 5:10 about the fact that our lives are our responsibility?</p>

<p>When have you done a good thing for a bad reason? What fear motivated you to say yes when you wanted to say no?</p>

<p>With the truth of Eph. 3:17 in mind, consider in what relationship you need to establish some boundaries today? What do you feel the risks are? When will you take a bold step of setting limits? Who will be there to support you with prayer?</p>

<p>How did the family you grew up deal with anger? What models did you have for what you do with anger?</p>

<p>Matt. 7:12 &ldquo;In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you.&rdquo; What does that rule say to you about boundaries?</p>

<p>An inability to receive someone&rsquo;s boundary may mean there is an idolatrous relationship. Whose boundaries &ndash; whose no &ndash; do you have an especially hard time accepting? Are you putting that person on the throne that should only be occupied by God?</p>

<p>What boundaries are you more willing to set now that you know they needn&rsquo;t be permanent?</p>

<p>What is God saying to you through this lesson on boundary myths?</p>

<p>Prayer</p>

<p>Gracious and good Father, you have promised that your truth shall set us free, and I thank you for the truths of this lesson. I&rsquo;ve had a glimpse of the freedom that comes with boundaries and with understanding boundaries. I ask now that you would help these truths &ndash; your truths &ndash; penetrate my heart. Help me to change my wrong assumptions and beliefs. Free me from false thinking and guide my actions. I continue to ask you to teach me to set boundaries. Please help me to do so wisely and always in love. I pray in your Son&rsquo;s name. Amen.</p>
