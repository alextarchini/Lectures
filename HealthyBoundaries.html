         1. "WHAT DOES A BOUNDARY LOOK LIKE?": 
         <!-- start-->
	<p>BOUNDARIES &ndash; Connect Group FEB to MAR 2021</p>

<p>I. What are boundaries? And what does a boundary look like?</p>

<p>Gen 1:28 &ldquo;Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Made in the image of God, we were created to take responsibility for certain tasks. Part of taking responsibility, or ownership, is knowing what our job is, and what is not.</p>

<p>Any confusion of responsibility or ownership in our lives is a problem of boundaries. We need to set mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual boundaries for our lives to help us distinguish what is our responsibility and what is not.</p>

<p>Many sincere, dedicated believers struggle with tremendous confusion about when it is biblically appropriate to set limits. Have you ever asked yourself the following questions?</p>

<p>1. Can I set limits and still be a loving person?</p>

<p>2. What are legitimate boundaries?</p>

<p>3. What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries?</p>

<p>4. How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money?</p>

<p>5. Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries?</p>

<p>6. How do boundaries relate to mutual submission within marriage?</p>

<p>7. Aren&rsquo;t boundaries selfish?</p>

<p>Physical boundaries are easy to see &ndash; stop signs, property lines, fences, walls, etc. Spiritual boundaries are just as real but harder to see. This first chapter is to help you define your boundaries.</p>

<p>A. Me and not Me</p>

<p>A boundary shows me where I end and where another begins. Knowing what I am to own and take responsibility for gives me freedom. Taking responsibility for my life opens up many different options.</p>

<p>Prov 14:10 &ldquo;Each heart knows its own bitterness, and no one else can share its joys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have the responsibility to deal with what is in our soul. The Bible tells us clearly what our parameters are and how to protect them. In addition to showing us what we are responsible for, boundaries help us define what is not our responsibility. Nowhere are we commanded to have &ldquo;over-control&rdquo;.</p>

<p>B. To and For</p>

<p>We are responsible TO others and FOR ourselves.</p>

<p>Gal 6:2 &ldquo;Carry each other&rsquo;s burdens, and in this way, you will fulfill the law of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Denying ourselves to do for others what they CANNOT do for themselves is showing the sacrificial love of Christ. This is being responsible TO.</p>

<p>Gal 6:5 &ldquo;each one should carry their own load.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one can do certain things FOR us. We have to carry/take responsibility for certain aspects of our lives that are our own &ldquo;load&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Problems arise when people act as if their &ldquo;boulders&rdquo; are daily loads and refuse help, or as if their &ldquo;daily loads&rdquo; are boulders they shouldn&rsquo;t have to carry.</p>

<p>C. Good in, Bad out</p>

<p>Boundaries help is to distinguish our property so that we can take care of it. We need to keep things that will nurture us inside our fences and keep things that will harm us outside.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have the bad on the inside and good on the outside. In this case, we need to be able to open up our boundaries to let the good in and the bad out. Our fences need gates in them.</p>

<p>Some of us have pain or sin within, and we need to open up and communicate with God and others about this, so that we can be healed.</p>

<p>James 5:16a &ldquo;Therefore confess your sons to one another [your false steps, your offenses], and pray for one another, that you may be healed and restored.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of us need to open up our gates and allow Jesus and His truth in. Also, other people have good things to give us and we need to learn to open our hearts to them. 2 Cor 6:11-13</p>

<p>D. God and boundaries</p>

<p>The concept of boundaries comes from the very nature of God. He defines Himself as a distinct, separate being, and He is responsible for Himself. He tells us what He thinks, feels, plans, allows, will not allow, likes and dislikes. He tells us who He is and is not.</p>

<p>God also confronts what He will not allow in His yard. He confronts sin and allows consequences for behavior.</p>

<p>E. Examples of boundaries</p>

<p>a. SKIN</p>

<p>The skin boundary keeps the good in and the bad out. It protects your blood and bones and keeps germs outside protecting you from infection.</p>

<p>b. WORDS</p>

<p>You can create good protective fences with your words. The most basic boundary-setting word is no. It lets others know that you exist apart from them and that you are in control of you. Being clear about your no &ndash; and your yes &ndash; is a theme that runs throughout the Bible.</p>

<p>People who have difficulty saying no, struggle with saying no to the control, pressure, demands, and sometimes real needs of others. They feel that if they say no to someone, they will endanger their relationship with that person, so they passively comply and inwardly resent. Sometimes the pressure comes from a person pressuring you to do something, sometimes it comes from our own sense of what we &ldquo;should&rdquo; do.</p>

<p>It is difficult for people to know where you stand when we do not use words to define our property. God shows us the example when he says: &ldquo;I like this, and I hate that.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;I will do this, and I will not do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>c. TRUTH</p>

<p>There is always safety in truth, whether it is knowing God&rsquo;s truth or the truth about ourselves. When we are in touch with God&rsquo;s truth, we are in touch with reality. Honesty about who we are gives us the biblical value of integrity, or oneness.</p>

<p>d. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE</p>

<p>Prov 22:3 &ldquo;the prudent see danger and take refuge;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes physically removing oneself from a situation will help maintain boundaries. It can be to replenish yourself as Jesus did when he left the crowds and retired by Himself. Or it can be to remove yourself from an abusive situation, to get away from danger.</p>

<p>e. TIME</p>

<p>Taking time off from a person or a project can be a way to take back your responsibility over some out-of-control aspects in your life. Adult children, for example, may need to spend some time building boundaries in order to create new ways to relate to their parents, since they have outgrown the old ways of relating. This can often lead to an improvement of the relationship between the children and their parents.</p>

<p>f. EMOTIONAL DISTANCE</p>

<p>This is a temporary boundary to allow space for your heart to heal. We should not continue to set ourselves up for hurt and disappointment. Many of us can be too quick to trust someone in the name of forgiveness and not make sure that the other is producing &ldquo;fruit in keeping with repentance&rdquo;. (Luke 3:8) It is good to forgive and it is also good to guard your heart.</p>

<p>g. OTHER PEOPLE</p>

<p>Other people are necessary to help us set and keep boundaries. Fear of being alone can keep many in hurtful patterns for years, being too afraid that if they set boundaries, they will not have love in their lives.</p>

<p>Also, many people have been taught by their church or their family that boundaries are unbiblical, mean, or selfish. This will be covered in a later chapter. But we need others to give us new input and teaching about biblical truth concerning boundaries.</p>

<p>Creating boundaries always involves a support system.</p>

<p>h. CONSEQUENCES</p>

<p>Just as the Bible sets consequences for certain behaviors, we also need to back up our boundaries with consequences.</p>

<p>2 Thess 3:10 &ldquo;if anyone will not work, don&rsquo;t let him/her eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>God does not enable irresponsible behavior. Consequences give some &ldquo;barbs&rdquo; to fences. They let people know the seriousness of the trespass and the seriousness of our respect for ourselves.</p>

<p>F. What is within my boundaries</p>

<p>a. FEELINGS</p>

<p>Feelings are not always respected for the God given gift they are, especially in the Christian world. They have been called unimportant or fleshly. But they play a huge role in our motivation and behavior.</p>

<p>Feelings should neither be ignored nor placed in charge. The Bible says to &ldquo;own&rdquo; our feelings and be aware of them. Feelings come from the heart and can tell you the state of your relationships.</p>

<p>Our feelings are our responsibility, and we must own them and see them as our problem, so we can begin to find an answer to whatever issue they are pointing to.</p>

<p>b. ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS</p>

<p>Attitudes are the stance you take towards others or something.</p>

<p>Beliefs are anything you accept as true.</p>

<p>We need to own our attitudes and convictions/beliefs because they fall within our property line. We are the ones who feel their effect and we are the only ones who can change them.</p>

<p>Those of us with boundary problems usually have a distorted attitude toward responsibility. We think that to hold people accountable for their feelings, choices, and behaviors is mean.</p>

<p>Prov 13: 18, 24</p>

<p>c. BEHAVIORS</p>

<p>Behaviors have consequences.</p>

<p>Gal 6:7 &ldquo;A man reaps what he sows&rdquo;</p>

<p>To rescue people from the natural consequences of their behavior is to render them powerless.</p>

<p>d. CHOICES</p>

<p>We need to take responsibility for our choices. This leads to the fruit of &ldquo;self-control&rdquo;. We need to realize that we are in control of our choices, no matter how we feel.</p>

<p>Making choices/decisions based on other&rsquo;s approval or on guilt breeds resentment.</p>

<p>Setting boundaries inevitably involves taking responsibility for our choices. We are the ones who make them. We are the ones who must live with their consequences. And we are the ones who may be keeping ourselves from making the choices we could be happy with.</p>

<p>e. VALUES</p>

<p>What we value is what we love and assign importance to.</p>

<p>We often get caught up in valuing the approval of man more than of God.</p>

<p>Boundaries help us not to deny but to own our old hurtful values so God can change them.</p>

<p>f. LIMITS</p>

<p>First the truth is that we do not have the power to set limits on others. What we can do is set limits on our own exposure to people who are not good for us.</p>

<p>God models this for us. He sets standards, but He lets people be who they are and then separates Himself from them when they misbehave, saying: &ldquo;You can be that way if you choose, but you cannot come into my house.&rdquo; Heaven is a place for the repentant and all are welcome.</p>

<p>What we need to learn is to say no to ourselves. We need to allow ourselves to have feelings, impulses, or desires but with self-control/without acting them out.</p>

<p>g. RESSOURCES AND GIFTS</p>

<p>Our talents, given to us by God, are our responsibility. Yet taking ownership of them can often be frightening. It takes work, practice, learning, and grace to overcome the fear of failure that the &ldquo;wicked and lazy&rdquo; servant gave in to (see Matt 25:23, 26-28). If we do not confront our fear, we deny God and insult both His giving of the gift and His grace to sustain us as we are learning.</p>

<p>h. THOUGHTS</p>

<p>Establishing boundaries in our thinking involves 3 things</p>

<p>a.i. We must own our own thoughts: We need to weigh the things we hear from other people. We need to examine if we are thinking our own thoughts or if we have accepted thoughts of others. We should never &ldquo;give our minds&rdquo; to someone else. We are to weigh things for ourselves in the context of relationship, sharpening each other as iron, but remaining separate thinkers.</p>

<p>a.ii. We must grow in knowledge and expand our minds: we do this by studying God&rsquo;s word. We also learn about God through His creation. By learning about His world, we obey the commandment to &ldquo;rule over&rdquo; the earth and all that is within it.</p>

<p>a.iii. We must clarify distorted thinking: we need to ask God to show us people in our lives as they really are. Taking ownership in relationships requires being active in checking out where we may be wrong. We also need to make sure to communicate our thoughts to others. &ldquo;For who knows a person&rsquo;s thoughts except their spirit within them.&rdquo; (1 Cor 2:11) We have our own thoughts, and if we want others to know them, we must tell them.</p>

<p>i. DESIRES</p>

<p>Our desires are our responsibility. We all have different desires and wants, dreams and wishes, goals and plans, hungers and thirsts.</p>

<p>Many desires can masquerade as the real thing. Sometimes our desire for love and affection can be masquerading as sexual desires.</p>

<p>God is interested in our desires, he made them. And like a good Father, He wants to give us what we truly need. But we don&rsquo;t always truly know what that is. We need to come to Him to figure that out.</p>

<p>j. LOVE</p>

<p>Our ability to give and respond to love is our greatest gift. The heart that God fashioned in His image is the center of our being.</p>

<p>Our loving heart, like our physical one, needs an inflow as well as an outflow of lifeblood. It is a trust muscle.</p>

<p>Many of us do not take ownership for how we resist love. We have a lot of love around us, but we do not realize that our loneliness is a result of our own lack of responsiveness. We have a responsibility to respond. We need to claim our hearts as our property and work on our weaknesses in that area.</p>

<p>Questions to work on:</p>

<p>Are there relationships in your life that lack boundaries? That feel unsafe? That are too demanding?</p>

<p>What problems have you taken on that God never asked you to take on? What motivated you to take them on?</p>

<p>What do you want to gain from this study on boundaries?</p>

<p>Looking at each example of boundaries:</p>

<p>Think of an example when people honored that boundary, and consider what hinders you from keeping each boundary strong?</p>

<p>What boundary set up by another person do you need to do a better job honoring?</p>

<p>Why do you have a hard time honoring certain boundaries in other people?</p>

<p>Looking at what is within your boundaries:</p>

<p>In which area are doing a good job taking responsibility?</p>

<p>In what area will you start working on taking more responsibility this week? What will you do? (be specific)</p>

            2. UNDERSTANDING BOUNDARIES: 
<!-- start -->
	<p>BOUNDARIES &ndash; Connect Group FEB to MAR 2021</p>

<p>II. Understanding boundaries</p>

<p>It is easy to misunderstand boundaries. At first glance, it seems as if the individual who has difficulty setting limits is the one who has the boundary problem; however, people who do not respect other&rsquo;s limits also have boundary problems.</p>

<p>This summary categorizes the main types of boundary problems. Boundary conflicts are not limited to those who &ldquo;can&rsquo;t say no&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Four types of boundary problems</p>

<p>1. Compliants: saying YES to the bad</p>

<p>Compliant people have fuzzy and indistinct boundaries, they melt into the demands and needs of other people.</p>

<p>When parents teach children that setting boundaries or saying no is bad, they are teaching them that others can do with them as they wish. Blocking a child&rsquo;s ability to say No handicaps that child for life.</p>

<p>Compliants minimize their differences with others so as not to rock the boat. The inability to say no to the bad is pervasive, it keeps them from refusing evil in their lives and often even from recognizing evil. Compliant people are chameleons.</p>

<p>Here are a couple reasons why some are Compliants:</p>

<p>Fear of hurting others&rsquo; feelings</p>

<p>Fear of abandonment and separateness</p>

<p>A wish to be totally dependent on another</p>

<p>Fear of someone else&rsquo;s anger</p>

<p>Fear of punishment</p>

<p>Fear of being shamed</p>

<p>Fear of being seen as selfish or bad</p>

<p>Fear of being unspiritual</p>

<p>Fear of one&rsquo;s own overstrict, critical conscience (guilty feelings &ndash; condemning oneself for things God Himself does not condemn us for)</p>

<p>2. Avoidants: saying NO to the good</p>

<p>Avoidance is the inability to ask for help, to recognize one&rsquo;s own needs and to let others in. Avoidants withdraw when they are in need; they do not ask for the support of others.</p>

<p>Boundaries are supposed to be able to &ldquo;breathe&rdquo;, to be like fences with a gate that can let the good in and the bad out.</p>

<p>Avoidants confuse boundaries for walls. Individuals with walls for boundaries can let in neither bad nor good. No one touches them.</p>

<p>God designed our personal boundaries to have gates. He designed us to enjoy safe relationships and avoid destructive ones. God even allows us the freedom to let him in or to close him off.</p>

<p>3. Controllers: not respecting others&rsquo; boundaries</p>

<p>Controllers can&rsquo;t respect other people&rsquo;s limits. They resist taking responsibility of their own lives, so they need to control other people&rsquo;s lives. They are perceived as bullies, manipulative and aggressive.</p>

<p>There are two types:</p>

<p>Manipulative controllers: they try to persuade people out of their boundaries, they talk others into saying YES. They use guilt messages, manipulate circumstances and seduce others into carrying their burdens. (Example: Isaac&rsquo;s son Jacob &ndash; Gen. 25:29-34 and Gen. 27:1-29)</p>

<p>Only when the manipulative controller is confronted with their dishonesty can they take responsibility for it, repent of it, and accept their and other&rsquo;s limits. (only after Jacob wrestled with God did he confront his manipulative boundary-lessness Gen. 32:24-32)</p>

<p>Aggressive controllers: they don&rsquo;t listen to or respect other people&rsquo;s boundaries. They run over other people&rsquo;s fences like a tank. They are sometimes verbally abusive and sometimes physically abusive, but most of the time they simply aren&rsquo;t aware that others even have boundaries. They neglect their own responsibility to accept others as they are.</p>

<p>(Peter is an example of an aggressive controller. Peter did not want to accept Jesus&rsquo; boundaries. Jesus immediately confronted Peter&rsquo;s violation of his boundaries. Mark 8:33)</p>

<p>Controllers are undisciplined people. They do a lot of damage to other people, but they themselves have boundary problems as well. Undisciplined they have little ability to delay gratification.</p>

<p>They are limited in their ability to take responsibility for owning their lives. They desperately need to learn to listen to the boundaries of others to help them observe their own.</p>

<p>Finally, controllers are isolated. They rarely feel loved because the people around them are there out of fear, guilt or dependency. At some deep level, controllers are aware of their isolation. (&ldquo;There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear.&rdquo; 1 John 4:18)</p>

<p>4. Non-responsive: not hearing the needs of others</p>

<p>While we should not take on the responsibility of others&rsquo; feelings, attitudes, and behaviors, we do have certain responsibilities to each other.</p>

<p>Non-responsives struggle with paying attention to the responsibilities of love. That is the opposite of what Prov. 3:27 or Rom. 12:18 exhorts us to do.</p>

<p>A key phrase here is &ldquo;in your power&rdquo; or &ldquo;so far as it depends on you&rdquo;. We can&rsquo;t bring peace to someone who doesn&rsquo;t accept it.</p>

<p>There are 2 groups:</p>

<p>- Those with a critical spirit toward others&rsquo; needs.</p>

<p>- Those who are so absorbed in their own desires and needs that they exclude others (a form of narcissism)</p>

<p>How Boundaries are Developped</p>

<p>A. Boundary development</p>

<p>Boundaries aren&rsquo;t inherited, they are built! God&rsquo;s desire is for you to know the wounds of your past. The past is your ally in repairing your present and ensuring a better future.</p>

<p>To be the truth-telling, responsible, free, and loving people God wants us to be, we need to learn limits in childhood, when our character is being formed. Good parenting helps children reach that goal (Prov 22:6). Good parenting is being a partner in helping young ones discover what God intended for them to be and helping them reach that goal.</p>

<p>B. Bonding: the foundation of boundary building</p>

<p>A basic need for boundary building is deep, abiding relationships with people who will love you no matter what. We cannot develop or set boundaries apart from supporting relationships with God and others.</p>

<p>Our deepest need is to belong, to be in a relationship, to have a spiritual and emotional &ldquo;home&rdquo;. It is the very nature of God to be in a relationship. The apostle John writes &ldquo;God is love&rdquo; and love means relationship &ndash; the caring, committed connection of one individual to another. (1 John 4:16) Like God, our most central need is to be connected.</p>

<p>We are built for relationship. Attachment is the foundation of the soul&rsquo;s existence. When this foundation is cracked, boundaries become impossible to develop. Because we lack relationship, we have nowhere to go in a conflict. We live in a vacuum. When we are not secure that we are loved, we are forced to choose between 2 bad options: setting limits at the risk of losing a relationship, or not setting limits and remaining a prisoner to the wishes of another person.</p>

<p>When infants successfully complete the first development task &ndash; that of bonding with Mom and Dad- they gain the security that comes with knowing they are loved. They develop an internal sense of belonging and safety even away from the presence of their mother. As children learn to feel safe and at home with their primary relationship, they are building good foundations to withstand the separateness and conflict that come with boundary development. It is God&rsquo;s plan for us to be loved enough by him and others so that we do not feel isolated even when we are alone.</p>

<p>C. Separation and individuation: the construction of the soul</p>

<p>As infants gain a sense of internal safety and attachment, a second need arises. The baby&rsquo;s need for autonomy, or independence, starts to emerge.</p>

<p>- Separation: perceiving himself or herself as distinct from Mother, a &ldquo;not me&rdquo; experience</p>

<p>- Individuation: developing an identity, a &ldquo;me&rdquo; experience</p>

<p>One must first determine who they are not before they can discover the true, authentic-aspects of their God-given identity.</p>

<p>Luke 2:41-49</p>

<p>In this biblical passage, the only one recorded from Jesus boyhood, we see a young man who knows who he is and who he is not. He has separated from his folks and individuated in his values, thoughts, and opinions. Three phases are critical to this kind of separation and individualization and to the development of healthy boundaries in childhood: hatching, practicing, and rapprochement.</p>

<p>- Hatching &ldquo;Mommy and I are not the same.&rdquo;: a time of exploration, of touching, of tasting and feeling new things.</p>

<p>- Practicing &ldquo;I can do Anything!&rdquo; (10 m to 18m): I can do anything &ndash; toddlers feel exhilaration and energy, with no impulse control, no boundaries on their passions.</p>

<p>The difference between hatching and practicing is radical. The hatching baby is overwhelmed by this new world and still leans a great deal on Mother, the practicing child is trying to leave her behind!</p>

<p>In the practicing phase, children learn that aggressiveness and taking initiative are good.</p>

<p>- Rapprochement &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do Everything.&rdquo; (18 m to 3 years): a restoration of harmonious relations. The connection with the Mother is important again but the child brings a more separate self into the relationship.</p>

<p>Typically, this is a difficult period &ndash; toddlers at this stage are temperamental, oppositional, and angry.</p>

<p>Here are some tools toddlers will use to build boundaries:</p>

<p> - Anger: It was created by God for a purpose &ndash; to tell us that there is a problem that needs to be confronted.</p>

<p> - Ownership: Being created in God&rsquo;s image also means having ownership, or stewardship. Me, My, Mine are not swear words but they must be applied in the correct way. Without a &ldquo;mine&rdquo;, we have no sense of responsibility to develop, nurture, and protect these resources. With good parenting, they will learn sacrifice and develop a giving, loving heart, but not until they have a personality that has been loved enough to give love away (1 John 4:19)</p>

<p> - No. The one-word boundary: Saying no gives them the power to make choices. It protects them. It is the first verbal boundary children learn. Though they can&rsquo;t make all the choices they&rsquo;d like, young children should be able to have a no that is listened to. Children also need to be able not only to give a no but also take a no.</p>

<p>Two additional periods of life focus on boundary building:</p>

<p> - The adolescent years are a reenactment of the first years of life.</p>

<p> - Young adulthood is the time when children leave home or college and start a career and/or get married.</p>

<p>The earlier the child learns good boundaries, the less turmoil he or she experiences later in life.</p>

<p>D. Boundary injuries &ndash; what goes wrong?</p>

<p>Generally, the earlier and more severe the injury, the deeper the boundary problem.</p>

<p>a. Withdrawal from boundaries:</p>

<p>Good relationships are built on the freedom to refuse and confront. Prov. 27:17</p>

<p>Parental limits are crucial. Parents need to stay attached and connected to their children even when they disagree with them. They can get angry, but they should not withdraw. It is crucial that kid&rsquo;s disagreement, their practices, their experimentation do not result in a withdrawal of love.</p>

<p>b. Hostility against boundaries:</p>

<p>If the parents show hostility, the children do not learn that delayed gratification and being responsible have benefits. They only learn how to avoid someone&rsquo;s wrath.</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s discipline teaches, it does not punish. (Heb 12:10-11)</p>

<p>c. Overcontrol:</p>

<p>It occurs when otherwise loving parents try to protect their children from making mistakes by having too strict rules and limits. The problem with overcontrol is that while a major responsibility of good parents is to control and protect, they must make room for children to make mistakes.</p>

<p>d. Lack of limits:</p>

<p>It is the opposite of hostility, but the resulting injuries can be just as severe. Ultimately no one can really escape the disciplines of life. We always reap what we sow.</p>

<p>e. Inconsistent limits:</p>

<p>Sometimes, due to their confusion about rearing children of their own injuries, some parents combine strict and lax limits, sending conflicting messages to children. Alcoholic families often exhibit inconsistent limits.</p>

<p>f. Trauma:</p>

<p>A trauma is an intensely painful emotional experience rather than a character pattern. A trauma can affect boundary development because it shakes up two necessary foundations to children&rsquo;s growth (i) the world is reasonably safe, and (ii) they have control over their lives.</p>

<p>Children who undergo trauma become unsure that they are safe and protected in this world, and become frightened that they have no say-so in any danger that approaches them.</p>

<p>Specific trauma &ndash; emotional, physical and sexual abuse, accidents and debilitating illnesses, death, divorce, or any other intensely painful experience &ndash; can injure boundary development.</p>

<p>The heart of God seems to beat especially close to the victim of trauma &ndash; &ldquo;He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted.&rdquo; Isa. 61:1</p>

<p>God desires for the wounds of the traumatized to be bound up by loving people.</p>

<p>g. Our own character traits:</p>

<p>We contribute by our own individual character styles. For example, some people with a constitutionally greater amount of aggression deal with boundary problems more confrontationally. And some with less aggression shy away from boundaries.</p>

<p>h. Our own sinfulness:</p>

<p>We also contribute to our own boundary development problems by our own depravity. Depravity is our resistance to being creatures under God, our resistance to humility.</p>

<p>Questions</p>

<p>i. As you were growing up, what did you learn about setting boundaries and saying no? Were those things good or bad?</p>

<p>ii. Do you condemn yourself for things that God does not condemn you for? Example?</p>

<p>iii. Are your boundaries more like walls than fences? Explain.</p>

<p>iv. In what situations have you been perceived as a controller? Why was it important for you to have control in that situation?</p>

<p>v. In which quadrant do you see yourself?</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t Say</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t Hear</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>Compliants: feel guilty and/or controlled by others; cannot set boundaries.</p>

<p>Controllers: aggressively or manipulatively violate others&rsquo; boundaries</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>Non-responsives: set boundaries against the responsibility of love</p>

<p>Avoidants: set boundaries against receiving care of others</p>

<p>BOUNDARIES &ndash; Connect Group FEB to MAR 2021</p>

<p>III. The Ten Laws of Boundaries &ndash; What the Bible says about boundaries.</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s world is set up with laws and principles. Spiritual realities are as real as gravity, and if you do not know them, you will discover their effects. Just because we have not been taught these principles of life and relationships does not mean they will not rule.</p>

<p>A. Law 1: The Law of Sowing and Reaping</p>

<p>The law of cause and effect is a basic law of life.</p>

<p>Gal. 6:7-8</p>

<p>When God tells us that we will reap what we sow, he is not punishing us; he is telling us how things really are.</p>

<p>- If you smoke cigarettes, you may get lung cancer</p>

<p>- If you overspend, you may have to deal with creditors</p>

<p>- If you eat right and exercise, you may have fewer health issues</p>

<p>- If you budget wisely, you may be able to pay your bills</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, people do not reap what they sow, because someone else steps in and reaps the consequences for them.</p>

<p>Just as we can interfere with the law of gravity by catching a glass tumbling off the table, people can interfere with the Law of Cause and Effect by stepping in and rescuing irresponsible people. Rescuing a person from the natural consequences of their behavior enables them to continue in irresponsible behavior. The Law is still at work, but the doer is not suffering the consequences; someone else is.</p>

<p>Today we call a person who continually rescues another person a codependent.</p>

<p>Establishing boundaries helps codependent people stop interrupting the Law of Sowing and Reaping in their loved one&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>Simply confronting is not enough: confronting an irresponsible person is not painful to them; only consequences are.</p>

<p>Codependent people bring insults and pain on themselves when they confront irresponsible people. In reality, they just need to stop interrupting the Law of Sowing and Reaping in someone&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>B. Law 2: The Law of Responsibility</p>

<p>Have you ever heard someone say: &ldquo;Setting boundaries is so self-centered. We should love one another and deny ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is an unbiblical view on boundaries.</p>

<p>The law of responsibility includes loving others. John 15:12 and Gal. 5:13-14</p>

<p>Problems arise when boundaries of responsibility are confused. We are to love one another, not be one another. In short, I cannot grow for you; only you can. In the same way, you cannot grow for me. You are responsible for yourself and I am responsible for myself. Phil. 2:12-13</p>

<p>An important aspect of being responsible &ldquo;to&rdquo; is not only in the giving but in the setting of limits on another&rsquo;s destructive and irresponsible behavior.</p>

<p>C. Law 3: The Law of Power</p>

<p>Am I powerless over my behavior? If I am, how can I become responsible? What DO I have the power to do?</p>

<p>In Rom. 7:15, 19, 23, Paul confesses his powerlessness.</p>

<p>John says that we are all in that state, and anyone who denies it is lying &ndash; 1 John 1:8</p>

<p>Though you do not have the power in and of yourself to overcome addictions or patterns of behavior, you do have the power to do some things that will bring fruits of victory later.</p>

<p>a) You have the power to agree with the truth about your problems. This is called &ldquo;confession&rdquo;, which means to &ldquo;agree with&rdquo;.</p>

<p>b) You have the power to submit your inability to God. You may not be able to make yourself well, but you can call the doctor! (1 John 1:9; James 4:7-10; Matt. 5:3, 6)</p>

<p>c) You have the power to search and ask God and others to reveal more and more about what is within your boundaries.</p>

<p>d) You have the power to turn from the evil that you find within you. This is called &ldquo;repentance&rdquo;, which means you can see your sinful parts as aspects that you want to change.</p>

<p>e) You have the power to humble yourself and ask God and others to help you with your developmental injuries and leftover childhood needs.</p>

<p>f) You have the power to seek out those whom you have injured and make amends. Matt. 5:23-24</p>

<p>Serenity Prayer (probably the best boundary prayer ever written)</p>

<p>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,</p>

<p>the courage to change the things I can,</p>

<p>and the wisdom to know the difference.</p>

<p>You can work on submitting yourself to the process and working with God to change you. You cannot change anything else: not the weather, the past, the economy &ndash; and especially not other people.</p>

<p>You cannot change others.</p>

<p>What you can do is influence others. But there is a trick. Since you cannot get them to change, you must change yourself so that their destructive patterns no longer work on you. So, pray for the wisdom to know the difference between what you have the power to change and what you do not.</p>

<p>D. Law 4: The Law of Respect</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t accept me if I say no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they will get angry if I set limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t speak to me for a week if I tell them how I feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We fear that others will not respect our boundaries.</p>

<p>Sometimes the problem is that we judge the boundary decisions of others, thinking that we know best how they &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to give&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could they refuse to come by and pick me up? It is right on their way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so selfish of her not to come to the church gathering. After all, the rest of us are sacrificing our time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems that, after all I do for you, you could at least do me this one little favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is where the law of respect comes in. As Jesus said, &ldquo;So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you&rdquo; (Matt. 7:12)</p>

<p>We need to love the boundaries of others to command respect for our own.</p>

<p>Freedom begets freedom.</p>

<p>When we accept others&rsquo; freedom, we do not get angry, feel guilty, or withdraw our love when they set boundaries with us. When we accept others&rsquo; freedom, we feel better about our own.</p>

<p>E. Law 5: The Law of Motivation</p>

<p>The Bible says that true love leads to a blessed state and a state of cheer. Love brings happiness, not depression. If your loving is depressing you, it is probably not true love.</p>

<p>Some of us learn early in life that if we did not do what our parent wanted; they would withdraw their love from us. We then learn to fear angry confrontations, and this fear keep us from saying no to others.</p>

<p>a. Fear of loss of love, or abandonment</p>

<p>People who say yes and then resent saying yes fear losing someone&rsquo;s love. They give to get love, and when they do not get it, they feel abandoned.</p>

<p>b. Fear of others&rsquo; anger</p>

<p>Because of old hurts and poor boundaries, some people cannot stand for anyone to be mad at them.</p>

<p>c. Fear of loneliness</p>

<p>Some people give in to others because they feel that that will &ldquo;win&rdquo; love and end their loneliness.</p>

<p>d. Fear of losing the &ldquo;good me&rdquo; inside</p>

<p>We are made to love. As a result, those who have this fear, when they are not loving, they are in pain. Many people cannot say, &ldquo;I love you and I do not want to do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>e. Guilt</p>

<p>Many people&rsquo;s giving is motivated by guilt. When they say no, they feel bad. So, they keep trying to earn a sense of goodness.</p>

<p>f. Payback</p>

<p>Many people have received things with guilt messages attached &ndash; &ldquo;I never had it as good as you.&rdquo; &ldquo;You should be ashamed of all you get&rdquo;. They feel a burden to pay for all they have been given.</p>

<p>g. Approval</p>

<p>Many feel as if they are still children seeking parental approval. Therefore, when someone wants something from them, they need to give so that this symbolic parent will be &ldquo;well pleased&rdquo;.</p>

<p>h. Over-identification with others&rsquo; loss</p>

<p>Many times, people have not dealt with all their disappointments and losses, so whenever they deprive someone else with a no, they &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the other person&rsquo;s sadness to the nth degree. They cannot stand to hurt somebody that badly, so they comply.</p>

<p>F. Law 6: The Law of Evaluation</p>

<p>We need to evaluate the effects of setting boundaries and be responsible to the other person, but that does not mean we should avoid setting boundaries because someone responds with hurt or anger. To have boundaries is to live a purposeful life.</p>

<p>Jesus refers to it as the &ldquo;narrow gate&rdquo;. Only the honest, purposeful life leads to good fruit. Deciding to set boundaries is difficult because it requires decision making and confrontation, which, in turn, may cause pain to someone you love.</p>

<p>We need to evaluate the pain caused by our making choices and empathize with it.</p>

<p>Example: A child chooses to go skiing with friends rather than coming home for Christmas. The child&rsquo;s choice may cause their parents sadness, but they are not harmed. A loving response from the child toward their parent&rsquo;s expression of sadness at the news would be, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sad that we won&rsquo;t be together too. I&rsquo;m looking forward to coming home over the summer.&rdquo; If the parents are respectful of their child&rsquo;s freedom to make choices, their response would sound something like this, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed that you are not coming home for Christmas, but I hope you will have a great time with your friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We cause pain by making choices that others do not like, but we also cause pain by confronting people when they are wrong. By if we do not share our anger with another, bitterness and hatred can set in. (Eph. 4:25)</p>

<p>As iron sharpens iron, we need confrontation and truth from others to grow.</p>

<p>G. Law 7: The Law of Proactivity</p>

<p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Paul says that wrath and sinful passions are a direct reaction to the severity of the law (Rom. 4:15; 5:20; 7:5). In Ephesians and Colossians, he says that wrath and disillusionment can be reactions to parental injustice (Eph. 6:4; Col. 3:21).</p>

<p>Sometimes people when they start seeing a counselor/therapist, after complying for years, may react all the sudden very explosively. It is due to all their pent-up rage coming to the surface. This reactive phase of boundary creation is helpful, especially for victims. They need to get out of the powerless, victimized place in which they may have been forced by physical and sexual abuse, or by emotional blackmail and manipulation. We should herald their emancipation.</p>

<p>Reaction phases are necessary but not sufficient for the establishment of boundaries. Eventually, you must rejoin the human race you have reacted to, and establish connections as equals, loving your neighbor as yourself. This is the beginning of the establishment of proactive instead of reactive boundaries.</p>

<p>Proactive people should you what they love, what they want, what they purpose, and what they stand for. Proactive people are able to &ldquo;love others as themselves&rdquo;. They have mutual respect. They can &ldquo;die to self&rdquo; and not &ldquo;return evil for evil&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Spiritual adulthood has higher goals than &ldquo;finding yourself&rdquo;. A reactive stage is a stage, not an identity. It is necessary but not sufficient.</p>

<p>H. Law 8: The Law of Envy</p>

<p>James 4:2 &ldquo;You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Envy is probably the basest emotion we have.</p>

<p>Envy defines &ldquo;good&rdquo; as &ldquo;what I do not possess&rdquo; and hates the good that it has.</p>

<p>Envy is a self-perpetuating cycle. Boundaryless people feel empty and unfulfilled. They look at another&rsquo;s sense of fullness and feel envious. This time and energy need to be spent on taking responsibility for their lack and doing something about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not because you ask not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Possessions and accomplishments are not the only things we envy. We can envy a person&rsquo;s character and personality instead of developing the gifts God has given us. (Rom. 12:6)</p>

<p>Scenarios &ndash; part 1:</p>

<p>A lonely man stays isolated and envious of the close relationships&rsquo; others have.</p>

<p>A single woman withdraws from social life, envying the marriages and families of her friends.</p>

<p>A middle-aged woman feels stuck in her career and wants to pursue something she would enjoy, yet she always has a &ldquo;yes, but&#8230;&rdquo; reason why she can&rsquo;t, resenting and envying those who have &ldquo;gone for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man chooses the righteous life but envies and resents those who seem to be &ldquo;having all the fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These people are all negating their own actions and comparing themselves to others (Gal. 4:6), staying stuck and resentful.</p>

<p>Scenarios &ndash; part 2:</p>

<p>A lonely man owns his lack of relationships and asks himself and God, I wonder why I always withdraw from people. I can at least go and talk to a counselor about this. Even if I am afraid of social situations, I could seek some help. No one should live this way. I will make the call.</p>

<p>The single woman asks; I wonder why I never get asked out and why I keep getting turned down for dates. What is wrong about what I am doing or how I am communicating or where I am going to meet people? How could I become a more interesting person? Maybe I could join a therapy group to find out why or could use a dating site to find people with interests similar to mine.</p>

<p>The middle-aged woman asks herself; Why am I reluctant to pursue my interests? Why do I feel selfish when I want to quit my job to do something I enjoy? What am I afraid of? If I were really honest, I would notice that the ones who are doing what they like have had to take risks and sometimes work and go to school to change jobs. That may be more than I am willing to do.</p>

<p>The righteous man asks himself; If I am really &ldquo;choosing&rdquo; to love and serve God, why do I feel like a slave? What is wrong with my spiritual life? What is it about me that envies someone living in the gutter?</p>

<p>These people are questioning themselves instead of envying others.</p>

<p>I. Law 9: The Law of Activity</p>

<p>Human beings are responders and initiators. Many times, we have boundary problems because we lack initiative &ndash; the God-given ability to propel ourselves into life.</p>

<p>The best boundaries are formed when a child is pushing against the world naturally and the outside world sets its limits on the child. In this way the aggressive child learns limits without losing their spirit. Our spiritual and emotional well-being depends on our having this spirit. (Matt. 25:14-30 &ndash; the active and assertive servants were rewarded&#8230;) The sad thing is that many people who are passive are not inherently bad people.</p>

<p>However, evil is an active force, and passivity can become an ally of evil by not pushing against it.</p>

<p>God will match our effort, but he will never do our work for us. (Matt. 25:14-30 &ndash; the &ldquo;wicked and lazy&rdquo; servant was passive)</p>

<p>The sin that God rebukes is not trying and failing but failing to try. (Heb. 10:38-39)</p>

<p>Passive &ldquo;shrinking back&rdquo; is intolerable to God, and when we understand how destructive it is to the soul, we can see why God does not tolerate it. God wants us to &ldquo;preserve our souls.&rdquo; That is the role of boundaries; they define and preserve our property, our soul.</p>

<p>Our boundaries can only be created by our being active and aggressive, by our knocking, seeking, and asking. (Matt. 7:7-8)</p>

<p>J. Law 10: The Law of Exposure</p>

<p>A boundary is a property line. We do not exist in a vacuum. We exist in relation to God and others. Your boundaries define you in relation to others.</p>

<p>The whole concept of boundaries has to do with the fact that we exist in relationship. Therefore, boundaries are really about relationship, and finally about love.</p>

<p>The law of exposure says that your boundaries need to be made visible to others and communicated to them in relationship.</p>

<p>We have many boundary problems because of relational fears &ndash; fears of guilt, not being liked, loss of love, loss of connection, loss of approval, receiving anger, being known, ...</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s plan is that we learn how to love. These relational problems can only be solved in relationships, for that is the context of the problems themselves, and the context of spiritual existence.</p>

<p>Because of our fears, we try to have secret boundaries. We withdraw passively and quietly instead of communicating an honest no to someone we love. We secretly resent instead of telling someone we are angry about how they have hurt us. Often, we will privately endure the pain of someone&rsquo;s irresponsibility instead of telling them how their behavior affects us and other loved ones, information that would be helpful to their soul.</p>

<p>In these instances, because of unexpressed boundaries, the relationships suffered.</p>

<p>An important thing to remember about boundaries is that they exist, and they will affect us, whether we communicate them or not. If our boundaries are not communicated and exposed directly, they will be communicated indirectly or through manipulation.</p>

<p>Eph. 4:25-26 &ldquo;In your anger do not sin: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The biblical mandate is to be honest and be in the light.</p>

<p>The Bible continually speaks of our being in the light and of the light as the only place where we have access to God and others. But because of our fears, we hide aspects of ourselves in the darkness, where the devil has an opportunity.</p>

<p>Healing always takes place in the light. Ps. 51:6 &ldquo;You desire truth in the innermost being, and in the hidden part you will make me know wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>God wants real relationship with us and wants us to have real relationship with each other. Real relationship means that I am in the light with my boundaries and other aspects of myself that are difficult to communicate. Our boundaries are affected by sin; they &ldquo;miss the mark&rdquo; and need to be brought into the light for God to heal them and others to benefit from them. This is the path to real love: Communicate your boundaries openly.</p>

<p>God has probably led you out of captivity also. Whether it was from a dysfunctional family, the world, your own religious self-righteousness, or the scatteredness of being lost, he has been your Redeemer. But what he has secured needs to be possessed. The land to which he has brought you has certain realities and principles. Learn these as set forth in his Word, and you will find his kingdom a wonderful place to live.</p>

<p>Questions to work on:</p>

<p>Which laws had the most to say to you?</p>

<p>How has your understanding of boundaries changed because of this lesson?</p>

<p>What is God saying to you through this lesson on the laws of boundaries?</p>

<p>What have you determined to do because of what you&rsquo;ve learned in this lesson about God&rsquo;s laws, boundaries and yourself?</p>

<p>Prayer</p>

<p>Creator and Redeemer God, thank you for the wondrous universe you&rsquo;ve fashioned and the laws that you&rsquo;ve established for its functioning. Thank you, too, that similar laws exist in the spiritual realm as well and that, through this study, I am learning more about those laws that govern relationships and my well-being. Father God, I see how these laws are rooted in your love, in your gracious, forgiving, and unconditional love. I ask therefore that you open my heart that I might learn these laws, practice them, internalize them, and ultimately find freedom in them, your laws of love. I pray in Jesus&rsquo; name. Amen.</p>

        <p>
            4. BOUNDARIES &ndash; 
		<!-- start -->
		
<p>IV. Common Boundary Myths</p>

<p>A myth is a fiction that looks like truth.</p>

<p>1. Myth 1: If I set boundaries, I&rsquo;m being selfish.</p>

<p>Christians have a deep-seated fear of being self-centered, interested only in one&rsquo;s own concerns and not those of others. The number one hallmark of Christians is that we love others (John 13: 35) &ndash; Is this self-centeredness? No.</p>

<p>Appropriate Boundaries actually increase our ability to care about others.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between selfishness and stewardship.</p>

<p>- Selfishness has to do with a fixation on our own wishes and desires to the exclusion of our responsibility to love others. Though having wishes and desires is a God-given trait (Prov. 13:4), we are to keep them in line with healthy goals and responsibility.</p>

<p>God is much more interested in meeting our needs than he is granting all our wishes (Phil. 4:12-13; 4:19). At the same time, God does not make our wishes and desires &ldquo;all bad&rdquo; either. He will meet many of them (Psalm 37:4).</p>

<p>Even if we have God&rsquo;s help, it is crucial to understand that meeting our own needs is basically our job (Matt. 7:7); the biblical picture is clear: our lives are our responsibility. (Phil 2:13).</p>

<p> - Stewardship: Just as a store manager takes good care of a shop for the owner, we are to do the same with our souls. If a lack of boundaries causes us to mismanage the store, the owner has the right to be upset with us.</p>

<p>We are to develop our lives, abilities, feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.</p>

<p>When we say no to people and activities that are harmful to us, we are protecting God&rsquo;s investment.</p>

<p>As you can see, there is quite a difference between selfishness and stewardship.</p>

<p>2. Myth 2: Boundaries are a sign of disobedience.</p>

<p>Many Christians fear that setting and keeping limits signals rebellion or disobedience.</p>

<p>The truth is life-changing: a lack of boundaries is often a sign of disobedience.</p>

<p>People who have shaky limits are often compliant on the outside but rebellious and resentful on the inside. (&ldquo;&#8230;thoughts and attitudes of the heart&rdquo; Heb. 4:12)</p>

<p>An internal no nullifies an external yes. (Hos. 6:6)</p>

<p>If we say yes to God or anyone else when we really mean no, we move into a position of compliance. We must always say yes out of a heart of love. (2 Cor. 9:7)</p>

<p>When our motive is fear - of a real person or a guilty conscience &ndash; we love not. And God doesn&rsquo;t want us to obey out of fear, but out of love.</p>

<p>Boundaries can be a sign of disobedience. We can say no to good things for wrong reasons but having that no &ndash; setting that boundary &ndash; helps us clarify, to be honest, and to tell the truth about our motives. Then we can allow God to work in us.</p>

<p>3. Myth 3: If I begin setting boundaries, I will be hurt by others.</p>

<p>Many people genuinely believe in the necessity of boundaries but are terrified of their consequences. It is possible that others will become angry at our boundaries and attack, or worse, withdraw from us. God never gave us the power or the right to control how others respond to our no.</p>

<p>Read the account of Jesus and the rich young man (Matt 19: 16-22)</p>

<p>We cannot manipulate people into swallowing our boundaries by sugarcoating them.</p>

<p>Boundaries are a &ldquo;litmus test&rdquo; for the quality of our relationships. Those people in our lives who can respect our boundaries will love our wills, our opinions, our separateness. Those who can&rsquo;t respect our boundaries are telling us that they don&rsquo;t love our no. They only love our yes, in other words, our compliance.</p>

<p>Setting limits has to do with telling the truth.</p>

<p>First there is the person who welcomes your boundaries, who accepts them, who listens to them, who says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you have a separate opinion. It makes me a better person.&rdquo; This person is called wise, or righteous.</p>

<p>Secondly there is the person who hates limits, who resents your difference, who tries to manipulate you into giving up your treasures.</p>

<p>To differentiate between the two types of people, try the &ldquo;litmus test&rdquo; and tell your significant relationships no in some area. You will either come out with increased intimacy or learn that there was very little intimacy to begin with.</p>

<p>Now it is not wise to immediately alienate yourself from everyone important to you. It is good to remember that we are made for relationship and that we do need people.</p>

<p>It is only from a place of being &ldquo;rooted and grounded in love&rdquo; (Eph. 3:17) that you can safely begin learning to tell the truth. Such bonds enable us to set boundaries. And while some people will abandon or attack us for having boundaries, it is better to know about their character so that we can take steps to fix the problem.</p>

<p>4. Myth 4: If I set boundaries, I will hurt others.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;hurt silence&rdquo; &#8230;</p>

<p>If this is the case, the problem is that you are seeing boundaries as an offensive weapon. Nothing could be further from the truth. Boundaries are a defensive tool.</p>

<p>Appropriate boundaries don&rsquo;t control, attack of hurt anyone. They simply prevent your treasures from being taken at the wrong time. The principle speaks not only to those who would like to control or manipulate us, but it also applies to the legitimate needs of others.</p>

<p>Even when someone has a valid problem, there are times when for some reason we can&rsquo;t sacrifice. Jesus left the multitudes, for example, to be alone with his Father (Matt. 14:22-23). We all need more than God and a best friend. We need a group of supportive relationships because having more than one person in our lives allows our friends to be human, to be busy, to be unavailable at times, to hurt and to have problems of their own, and to have time alone.</p>

<p>This is the beauty behind the Bible&rsquo;s teachings on the church, the body of Christ. We are a group of lumpy, bumpy, unfinished sinners who ask for help and give help, who ask again and give again. And when our supportive network is strong enough, we all help each other mature into what God intended us to be: &ldquo;bearing with one another in love. Mak[ing] every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.&rdquo; (Eph. 4:2-3)</p>

<p>In these supportive relationships, we also learn that other people can tolerate our no. When our supportive network is strong enough, we all help each other mature into what God intended us to be (Eph 4:2-3). And we can accept a no from God. He knows we take responsibility for our lives &ndash; and sometimes a no helps us do just that.</p>

<p>5. Myth 5: Boundaries mean that I&rsquo;m angry.</p>

<p>Quite often, when people being telling the truth, setting limits, and taking responsibility, an &ldquo;angry cloud&rdquo; follows them around for a while. They become touchy and easily offended, and they discover a hair-trigger temper that frighten them.</p>

<p>Boundaries don&rsquo;t cause anger in us. Emotions, or feelings, have a function.</p>

<p>- Fear tells us to move away from danger, to be careful.</p>

<p>- Sadness tells us that we&rsquo;ve lost something, a relationship, an opportunity, or an idea.</p>

<p>- Anger is, like all other emotions, a signal. It signals danger. Instead of withdrawing, anger is a sign that we must move forward to confront the threat. Anger tells us that our boundaries have been violated. It can tell us we are in danger of being injured or controlled. Anger also provides us with a sense of power to solve a problem. It energizes us to protect ourselves, those we love, and our principles.</p>

<p>As with all emotions, anger doesn&rsquo;t understand time. It doesn&rsquo;t dissipate automatically if the danger occurred two minutes ago or 20 years ago!</p>

<p>It must be worked through appropriately. Otherwise, anger simply lives inside the heart. This is why individuals with injured boundaries are often shocked by the rage they feel inside when they begin setting limits. This is generally not &ldquo;new anger&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;old anger&rdquo;. Years of constant boundary violations generate great anger.</p>

<p>As hostile feelings surface bring them to relationship. Confess them. The Bible tells us to tell the truth to each other about our lacks so that we may be healed (James 5:16).</p>

<p>The first step is to experience the grace of God through others who will love you in your anger.</p>

<p>The second step is to rebuild the injured parts of your soul. Take responsibility for healing the &ldquo;treasures&rdquo; that may have been violated. The more we heal, the less anger we feel.</p>

<p>Finally, as you develop a sense of biblical boundaries, you find more safety in the present. You are more confident and less enslaved to your fear of others. As you develop better boundaries, you have less need for anger.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t fear the rage you discover when you first begin developing boundaries. It is the protest of earlier parts of your soul, parts that need to be unveiled, understood, and loved by God and people. Then you need to take responsibility for healing them and developing better boundaries.</p>

<p>Individuals with mature boundaries are the least angry people in the world. Because they prevent boundary violation in the first place, they are more in control of their lives and values and don&rsquo;t need anger.</p>

<p>6. Myth 6: When others set boundaries, it injures me.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at why accepting other&rsquo;s boundaries is such a problem.</p>

<p>First, having inappropriate boundaries set on us can injure us, especially in childhood. A parent can hurt a child by not providing the correct amount of emotional connection at the appropriate time. Children&rsquo;s emotional and psychological needs are primarily the responsibility of the parents.</p>

<p>Second, we project our own injuries onto others. When we feel pain, one response is to &ldquo;disown&rdquo; the bad feeling and to throw it onto others. This is called projection. Sensing their own pain in others, they will avoid setting limits on others, as they imagine how devastating it would be to them.</p>

<p>Third, an inability to receive someone&rsquo;s boundary may mean there is an overdependent relationship. Though we certainly need each other, no one but God is totally indispensable.</p>

<p>When a conflict with one significant person can bring us to despair, it is possible that we are too focused and dependent on that person to meet our needs. Such dependency is appropriate for children, but they are to grow out of this in adulthood and move into having several healthy and supportive relationships.</p>

<p>Ask yourself: &ldquo;If the person I can&rsquo;t hear no from were to die tonight, to whom would I go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to develop several deep, significant relationships. This allows those in our lives to feel free to say no to us without guilt because we have somewhere else to go.</p>

<p>When we have a person we can&rsquo;t take no from, we have, in effect, handed over the control of our lives to them.</p>

<p>Fourth, an inability to accept others&rsquo; boundaries can indicate a problem in taking responsibility. Some people become so accustomed to others rescuing them that they begin to believe that their well-being is someone else&rsquo;s problem.</p>

<p>In 2 Cor. 7:8-9, Paul strongly confronted the Corinthians. They accepted and responded well to Paul&rsquo;s boundaries, whatever they were.</p>

<p>Since being on the receiving end of boundaries is hurtful, we may vow never to hurt someone else by maintaining our boundaries.</p>

<p>In Matthew 7:12, Jesus shares the Golden rule: &ldquo;In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you want others to respect your boundaries, then you must be willing to respect the boundaries of others.</p>

<p>7. Myth 7: Boundaries Cause Feelings of Guilt</p>

<p>One of our major obstacles to setting boundaries with others in our lives is our feelings of obligation. What do we owe not only our parents but anyone who has been loving toward us? What is appropriate and biblical, and what is not? Many individuals solve this dilemma by avoiding setting boundaries with those to whom they feel an obligation.</p>

<p>The idea is that because we have received something, we owe something. However, &ldquo;gift&rdquo; implies no string attached. All that is really needed is gratitude. That is how God views his gift of salvation to us. It cost him his son. It was motivated out of love for us. And our response is to receive it and be grateful.</p>

<p>What do we owe those who are kind to us, who have genuinely cared for us? We owe them thanks.</p>

<p>We need to distinguish here between those who &ldquo;give to get&rdquo; and those who truly give selflessly. It&rsquo;s generally easy to tell the difference. If the giver is hurt or angered by a sincere thanks, the gift was probably a loan. If the gratitude is enough, you probably received a legitimate gift with no feelings of guilt attached.</p>

<p> Sometimes moving on from a church a job or a friend would be a mature move, but feelings of obligation keep us from doing so.</p>

<p>8. Myth 8: Boundaries are permanent, and I&rsquo;m afraid of burning my bridges.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that your no is always subject to you. You own your boundaries; they do not own you. You can always renegotiate the boundary. You can change the boundary if you are in a safer place.</p>

<p>Changing and renegotiating boundaries has many biblical precedents.</p>

<p>- God chose not to destroy Nineveh when the city repented. (Jonah 3:10)</p>

<p>- Paul rejected John Mark for a mission trip because the younger man had deserted Paul (Acts 15:37-39) &ndash; yet, years later, Paul requested John Mark&rsquo;s companionship (2 Tim. 4:11)</p>

<p>As you can see, some of these myths are genuine misconceptions you may have learned from distorted teachings. Yet others simply result from the fear of standing up and saying no to unbiblical responsibility.</p>

<p>Prayerfully review which myths have entangled and ensnared you.</p>

<p>Questions to work on:</p>

<p>How do you define selfishness?</p>

<p>What does Paul say in 2 Cor 5:10 about the fact that our lives are our responsibility?</p>

<p>When have you done a good thing for a bad reason? What fear motivated you to say yes when you wanted to say no?</p>

<p>With the truth of Eph. 3:17 in mind, consider in what relationship you need to establish some boundaries today? What do you feel the risks are? When will you take a bold step of setting limits? Who will be there to support you with prayer?</p>

<p>How did the family you grew up deal with anger? What models did you have for what you do with anger?</p>

<p>Matt. 7:12 &ldquo;In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you.&rdquo; What does that rule say to you about boundaries?</p>

<p>An inability to receive someone&rsquo;s boundary may mean there is an idolatrous relationship. Whose boundaries &ndash; whose no &ndash; do you have an especially hard time accepting? Are you putting that person on the throne that should only be occupied by God?</p>

<p>What boundaries are you more willing to set now that you know they needn&rsquo;t be permanent?</p>

<p>What is God saying to you through this lesson on boundary myths?</p>

<p>Prayer</p>

<p>Gracious and good Father, you have promised that your truth shall set us free, and I thank you for the truths of this lesson. I&rsquo;ve had a glimpse of the freedom that comes with boundaries and with understanding boundaries. I ask now that you would help these truths &ndash; your truths &ndash; penetrate my heart. Help me to change my wrong assumptions and beliefs. Free me from false thinking and guide my actions. I continue to ask you to teach me to set boundaries. Please help me to do so wisely and always in love. I pray in your Son&rsquo;s name. Amen.</p>

		<p>BOUNDARIES &ndash; Connect Group FEB to MAR 2021</p>

<p>V. Boundaries with your family, your spouse, your children</p>

<p>A. Boundaries with your family.</p>

<p>Nadia, a thirty-year-old woman would return from a visit to her parent&rsquo;s home and suffer a deep depression. When she described the problem to her therapist, he asked her if she noticed that every time she went home to visit, she came back extremely depressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s ridiculous,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t live there anymore. How could the trip affect me this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When her therapist asked her to describe the trip, Nadia told of social gatherings with old friends and family times around the dinner table. She described those times as fun, especially when it was only family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;only family&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, other times my parents would invite some of my friends over, and I didn&rsquo;t like those dinners as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Nadia thought for a minute and then replied, &ldquo;I guess I start to feel guilty.&rdquo; She began to recount the subtle remarks her parents would make comparing her friends&rsquo; lives to hers. They would talk of how wonderful it is for grandparents to have a &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; role in raising the children. They would talk of the community activities her friends were doing and how wonderful she would be at those activities if she only lived there. The list went on and on.</p>

<p>Nadia soon discovered that, when she returned home, she felt as if she were bad for living where she lived. She had a nagging sense that she really should do what her parents wanted her to do.</p>

<p>Nadia had a common problem. She had made choices on the outside. But on the inside, she did not have emotional permission to be a separate person, make free choices about her life, and not feel guilty when she did not do what her parents wanted.</p>

<p>Remember, boundaries define someone&rsquo;s property. Some of us do not really &ldquo;own&rdquo; ourselves. People who own their lives do not feel guilty when they make choices about where they are going. They take other people into consideration, but when they make choices for the wishes of others, they are choosing out of love, not guilt; to advance a good not to avoid being bad.</p>

<p>1. Signs of a lack of boundaries.</p>

<p>Here are some common signs of a lack of boundaries with the family we grew up in.</p>

<p>a. Catching the virus</p>

<p>One sure sign of boundary problems is when your relationship with one person has the power to affect your relationships with others. You are giving one person way too much power in your life. Some of us fuse with many of one parent&rsquo;s ideas about ourselves and we are not able to stay separate.</p>

<p>b. Second fiddle</p>

<p>A common sign of a lack of boundaries with the family of origin: the spouse feels like they get leftovers. They feel as though their mate&rsquo;s real allegiance is to their parents. This spouse has not completed the &ldquo;leaving before cleaving&rdquo; process; they have a boundary problem. (Gen. 2:24) The Hebrew word for &ldquo;leave&rdquo; comes from a root word that means to &ldquo;loosen&rdquo;, or to relinquish or to forsake.</p>

<p>This does not mean that spouses should not have a relationship with their extended families. But they do need to set clear boundaries with their families of origin.</p>

<p>c. May I have my allowance, please?</p>

<p>A common boundary problem for young adults today, both married and single: they are not yet an adult financially. They struggle with setting boundaries on their parents&rsquo; desire for them to &ldquo;have everything the parents have.&rdquo; Young adults may even find that they have so fused with their parents&rsquo; ideas of success that they have trouble saying no to these wishes in themselves.</p>

<p>There is also the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in trouble&rdquo; side. Many adult children perpetually get into financial messes because of irresponsibility, drug or alcohol use, out-of-control spending, or the modern &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t found my niche&rdquo; syndrome. Their parents continue to finance this road of failure and irresponsibility, thinking that &ldquo;this time they&rsquo;ll do better.&rdquo; In reality, they are crippling their children for life, preventing them from achieving independence.</p>

<p>To be an adult, you must live within your means and pay for your own failures.</p>

<p>d. Mom, where are my socks?</p>

<p>In the perpetual child syndrome, a person may be financially on his own, but they allow their family of origin to perform certain life management functions. (Ex.: hanging out at Mom and Dad&rsquo;s often, going on vacation with them, dropping off laundry, has no savings or clear career path&#8230;)</p>

<p>On the surface these things may not appear to be serious problems. But often Mom and Dad are symbolically keeping their adult child from emotionally leaving home. It may not look like a problem because everyone gets along so well.</p>

<p>However, the adult children&rsquo;s other adult relationships may be dysfunctional. They may choose &ldquo;black sheep&rdquo; friends and lovers. They may be unable to commit to a member of the opposite sex or to a career. Often their finances are a problem.</p>

<p>Adolescents &ndash; and adult children who have not separated from their parents &ndash; are still under parental protection, and it is a parent&rsquo;s job to think about the future.</p>

<p>e. Three&rsquo;s a crowd</p>

<p>Dysfunctional families are known for a certain type of boundary problem called triangulation.</p>

<p>Triangulation is:</p>

<p>Person A is angry at Person B.</p>

<p>Person A does not tell Person B.</p>

<p>Person A calls Person C and gripes about Person B.</p>

<p>Person C enjoys Person A&rsquo;s confidence and listens whenever Person A wants to play the triangle game.</p>

<p>By then, Person B feeling lonely, calls Person C, and in passing mentions the conflict with Person A.</p>

<p>Person C becomes the confidant of Person B as well as Person A.</p>

<p>Persons A and B have not resolved their conflict, and Person C has two &ldquo;friends&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Triangulation is the failure to resolve a conflict between two persons and the pulling in of a third to take sides. This is a boundary problem because the third person has no business in the conflict but is used for comfort and validation by the ones who are afraid to confront each other. This is how conflicts persist, people don&rsquo;t change, and enemies are made unnecessarily.</p>

<p>What happens in the triangle is that people speak falsely, covering up their hatred with nice words and flattery.</p>

<p>This is a clear lack of boundaries because Person A is not &ldquo;owning&rdquo; their anger. The person with whom Person A is angry deserves to hear it straight from them.</p>

<p>In addition, Person C is being drawn into the conflict, and their knowledge of the conflict gets in the way of their relationship with Person B.</p>

<p>Gossip gets between people. It affects our opinions of the people being gossiped about without their having a chance to defend themselves.</p>

<p>The Bible is very serious about dealing with conflict DIRECTLY with the one you are angry with.</p>

<p>Prov. 28:23; Lev. 19:17; Matt. 5:23-24; Matt. 18:15. These scriptures show that a simple way to avoid triangulation is to always talk to the person with whom you have a conflict first. Work it out with them, and only if they deny the problem, talk to someone else to get insight about how to resolve it, not to gossip and to bleed off anger. Then you BOTH go to talk to them together to try to solve the problem. Never say to a third party something about someone that you do not plan to say to the person itself.</p>

<p>f. Who is the child here, anyhow?</p>

<p>2 Cor. 12:14 &ldquo;Children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some people were born to take care of their parents. They did not sign up for this duty; they inherited it. Today we call these people &ldquo;codependent&rdquo;. When they became adults, they had a difficult time setting boundaries between themselves and their irresponsible parents. Every time they tried to have separate lives, they felt selfish.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Bible teaches that adult children should take care of their elderly parents (1 Tim. 5:3-4). It is good to feel grateful to our parents and to repay them for what they have done for us.</p>

<p>But two problems generally crop up.</p>

<p>First, your parents may not be &ldquo;really in need&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Second, when they are &ldquo;really in need&rdquo;, you may not have clear boundaries to determine what you can give and what you cannot give.</p>

<p>A family needs to decide what they want to give and what they do not want to give, so they will continue to love and appreciate the parent and not grow resentful.</p>

<p>Good boundaries prevent resentment. Giving is good. Make sure, however, that it is the proper amount for your situation and resources.</p>

<p>g. But I am your brother/sister.</p>

<p>Another frequent dynamic is the grown sibling relationship. An irresponsible adult child depends on a responsible adult sibling to avoid growing up and leaving the family. The irresponsible child continues to play old family games well into adulthood.</p>

<p>The tough issue here is the guilt and pressure you feel because this person is your brother or sister. Our families can tear down our best built fences because they are &ldquo;family&rdquo;.</p>

<p>2. But why do we do that?</p>

<p>Why in the world do we choose to continue these sorts of patterns? What is wrong?</p>

<p>One reason is that we did not learn the laws of boundaries in our family of origin, and our adult boundary problems are actually old boundary problems that have been there since childhood.</p>

<p>Another reason is that we may not have gone through the biblical transition into adulthood and the spiritual adoption into the family of God.</p>

<p>Let us look at both:</p>

<p>a. Continuation of old boundary problems.</p>

<p>The patterns you learn at home growing up are continued into adulthood with the same players: lack of consequences for irresponsible behavior, lack of confrontation, lack of limits, taking responsibility for others instead of yourself, giving out of compulsion and resentment, envy, passivity, and secrecy.</p>

<p>These patterns run deep. Your family members are able to send you back to old patterns by their very presence. You begin to act automatically out of memory instead of growth.</p>

<p>To change, you must IDENTIFY these &ldquo;sins of the family&rdquo; and turn from them. You must confess them as sins, repent of them, and change the way you handle them.</p>

<p>Look at the struggles you are having with boundaries in your family of origin, identify which laws are being broken, and then pinpoint the resulting negative fruit in your life.</p>

<p>b. Adoption</p>

<p>Boundaries are an essential aspect of growing up. One step in growing up is coming out from under parental authority and putting yourself under God&rsquo;s authority. (Gal. 4:1-7)</p>

<p>When adulthood and the &ldquo;age of accountability&rdquo; comes, that person comes out from under guardians and managers and become responsible for themselves. God does not leave us as orphans but takes us into his family.</p>

<p>Matt. 23:9, God commands us to look to him as our Father and to have no parental intermediaries. Adults who are still holding an allegiance to earthly parents have not realized their new adoptive status.</p>

<p>When we become part of God&rsquo;s family, obeying his ways will sometimes cause conflict in our families and sometimes separate us (Matt. 10:35-37). Jesus says that our spiritual ties are the closest and most important (Matt. 12:46-50).</p>

<p>Our true family is the family of God. Strong standards and values make this family run. And God will not allow any other way in his family. We are also to have friends outside of God&rsquo;s family and strong ties with our family of origin. But we need to ask ourselves two questions: (i) do these ties keep me from doing the right thing in any situation? (ii) Have we really become an adult in relation to our family of origin?</p>

<p>If we are not &ldquo;subject to guardians and trustees&rdquo; as adults (Gal. 4:2), we can make truly adult decisions, having control over our own will (1 Cor. 7:37), subject to our true Father.</p>

<p>3. Resolution of boundary problems with family.</p>

<p>Establishing boundaries with families of origin is a tough task but one with great reward.</p>

<p>a. Identify the symptom.</p>

<p>Look at your own life situation and see where boundary problems exist with your parents and siblings.</p>

<p>Where have you lost control of your property?</p>

<p>b. Identify the conflict.</p>

<p>Discover what dynamic is being played out. What laws of boundaries are you violating?</p>

<p>You cannot stop acting out a dynamic until you understand what you are doing. &ldquo;Take the log out&rdquo; of your own eye. Then you will be able to see clearly to deal with your family members. See yourself as the problem and find your boundary violations.</p>

<p>c. Identify the need that drives the conflict.</p>

<p>You do not act in inappropriate ways for no reason. You are often trying to meet some underlying need that your family of origin did not meet.</p>

<p>You must face this deficit and accept that it can only be met in your new family of God, those who are now your true &ldquo;mother, father, brothers, and sisters,&rdquo; those who do God&rsquo;s will and can love you the way he designed.</p>

<p>d. Take in and receive the good.</p>

<p>It is not enough to understand your need. You must get it met. God is willing to meet your needs through his people, but you must humble yourself, reach out to a good support system, and take in the good.</p>

<p>Learn to respond to and receive love, even if you are clumsy at first.</p>

<p>e. Practice boundary skills.</p>

<p>Your boundary skills are fragile and new. You cannot take them immediately into a difficult situation. Practice them in situations where they will be honored and respected. Begin saying no to people in your supportive group who will love and respect your boundaries.</p>

<p>f. Say no to the bad.</p>

<p>In addition to practicing new skills in safe situations, avoid hurtful situations. When you are in the beginning stages of recovery, you need to avoid people who have abused and controlled you in the past.</p>

<p>Be aware of your pull toward hurtful situations and relationships. Be careful not to get sucked into a controlling situation again because your wish for reconciliation is so strong.</p>

<p>When you think you are ready to reestablish a relationship with someone who has been abusive and controlling in the past, bring a friend or supporter along.</p>

<p>g. Forgive the aggressor.</p>

<p>Nothing clarifies boundaries more than forgiveness. When you refuse to forgive someone, you still want something from that person, and even if it is revenge you want, it keeps you tied to that person forever.</p>

<p>It is much better to receive grace from God, who has something to give, and to forgive those who have no money to pay their debt. (Prov. 13:12)</p>

<p>If you do not forgive, you are demanding something your offender does not choose to give, even if it is only confession of what they did. This ties you to them and ruins boundaries. Let go of the dysfunctional family you came from. Cut it loose, and you will be free.</p>

<p>h. Respond, do not react.</p>

<p>When you react to something that someone says or does, you may have a problem with boundaries. If someone is able to cause havoc by doing or saying something, they are in control of you at that point, and your boundaries are lost.</p>

<p>When you respond, you remain in control, with options and choices.</p>

<p>If you feel yourself reacting, step away and regain control of yourself.</p>

<p>The difference between responding and reacting is choice. When you are reacting, they are in control. When you respond, you are.</p>

<p>i. Learn to love in freedom and responsibility, not in guilt.</p>

<p>The best boundaries are loving ones. Boundaries in no way mean to stop loving. They mean the opposite: you are gaining freedom to love. It is good to sacrifice and deny yourself for the sake of others. But you need boundaries to make that choice.</p>

<p>Doing good for someone, when you freely choose to do it, is boundary enhancing.</p>

<p>B. Boundaries and your spouse.</p>

<p>Boundaries foster separateness. Marriage has as one of its goals the giving up of separateness and becoming, instead of two, one. (Eph. 5:31) What a potential state of confusion, especially for someone who does not have clear boundaries to begin with!</p>

<p>More marriages fail because of poor boundaries than for any other reason.</p>

<p>1. Is This Yours, Mine, or Ours?</p>

<p>A marriage mirrors the relationship that Christ has with his bride, the church. Christ has some things that only he can do, the church has some things that only it can do, and they have some things they do together.</p>

<p>Similarly, in marriage, some duties one spouse does, some the other does, and some they do together. When the two become one on their wedding day, spouses do not lose their individual identities.</p>

<p>The problem arises when one trespasses on the other&rsquo;s personhood, when one crosses a line and tries to control the feelings, attitudes, behaviors, choices, and values of the other. These things only each individual can control.</p>

<p>Our relationship with Christ &ndash; and any other successful relationship &ndash; is based on freedom.</p>

<p>a. Feelings</p>

<p>One of the most important elements that promotes intimacy between two people is the ability of each to take responsibility for his or her own feelings.</p>

<p>We do not communicate our feelings by saying, &ldquo;I feel that you&#8230;&rdquo; We communicate our feelings by saying, &ldquo;I feel sad, or hurt, or lonely, or scared, or&#8230;&rdquo; Such vulnerability is the beginning of intimacy and caring.</p>

<p>Feelings are also a warning signal telling us that we need to do something. For example, if you are angry at someone for something they did, it is your responsibility to go to them and tell them you are angry and why. If you think that your anger is their problem and that they need to fix it, you may wait years. If you are angry, even if someone else has sinned against you, it is your responsibility to do something about it.</p>

<p>Not dealing with hurt or anger can kill a relationship.</p>

<p>b. Desires</p>

<p>Desires are another element of personhood for which each spouse needs to take responsibility. Marriage is about getting conflicting wants worked out.</p>

<p>Problems arise when we make someone else responsible for our needs and wants, and when we blame that person for our disappointments.</p>

<p>c. Limits on what I can give.</p>

<p>We are finite creatures and must give as we decide &ldquo;in [our] heart to give&rdquo; (2 Cor. 9:7), being aware of when we are giving past the love point to the resentment point. Problems arise when we blame someone else for our own lack of limits. Often spouses will do more than they really want to and then resent the other for not stopping them from overgiving.</p>

<p>Sometimes we want our spouse to stop wanting instead of learning to say no. However, it is important for our spouse to learn that you are not going to take responsibility for their wants. You are going to give as you choose, and they are responsible for the rest.</p>

<p>2. Applying the laws of boundaries to marriage.</p>

<p>Let us apply a few of the laws to troubled marital situations.</p>

<p>a. The Law of Sowing and Reaping</p>

<p>Many times, one spouse may be out of control and may not suffer the consequences of this behavior.</p>

<p>For example: a husband yells at his wife, and she tries to be more loving. In effect, the evil (yelling) produces good things (more loving) for him. Or a wife overspends, and her husband pays the consequences. He gets a second job to cover the mound of bills.</p>

<p>Natural consequences are needed to resolve these problems.</p>

<p>These spouses all need to let the out-of-control spouses suffer the consequences of their actions. To do this is not manipulative, it is someone limiting how they will allow themselves to be treated and exhibiting self-control. The natural consequences are falling on the shoulders of the responsible party.</p>

<p>b. The Law of Responsibility</p>

<p>We talked earlier about taking responsibility for ourselves and having responsibility to others. People who set limits exhibit self-control and show responsibility for themselves. They act responsible to their partner by confronting them. Setting limits is an act of love in the marriage; by binding and limiting the evil, they protect the good.</p>

<p>Taking responsibility for someone&rsquo;s anger, pouting, and disappointments by giving in to that person&rsquo;s demands or controlling behavior destroys love in a marriage.</p>

<p>c. The Law of Power</p>

<p>We have looked at our basic inability to change another person. A complaining spouse, in effect, keeps the problem going. Accepting someone as they are, respecting their choice to be that way, and then giving them appropriate consequences is the better path. When we do this, we execute the power we do have, and we stop trying to wield the power no one has.</p>

<p>Contrast these ways of reacting:</p>

<p>Before boundaries</p>

<p>After boundaries</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop yelling at me. You must be nicer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can continue to yell if you choose to. But I will choose not to be in your presence when you act that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just got to stop drinking. It&rsquo;s ruining our family. Please listen. You&rsquo;re wrecking our lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may choose not to deal with your drinking if you want. But I will not continue to expose myself and the children to this chaos. The next time you are drunk, we will go to the Wilsons&rsquo; for the night, and we will tell them why we are there. Your drinking is your choice. What I will put up with is mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a pervert to look at pornography. That&rsquo;s so degrading. What kind of a sick person are you anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not choose to share you sexually with naked women online or in magazines. You need to get help for your pornography habit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These are all examples of taking power over what you do have power over &ndash; yourself &ndash; and giving up trying to control and have power over someone else.</p>

<p>d. The Law of Evaluation</p>

<p>When you confront your spouse and begin to set boundaries, your partner may be hurt. In evaluating the pain that your boundary setting causes your spouse, remember that love and limits go together. When you set boundaries, be lovingly responsible to the person in pain. Spouses who are wise and loving will accept boundaries and act responsibly toward them. Spouses who are controlling and self-centered will react angrily.</p>

<p>Remember that a boundary always deals with yourself, not the other person. You are not demanding that your spouse do something &ndash; even respect your boundaries. You are setting boundaries to say what you will do or will not do. Do not confuse boundaries with a new way to control a spouse.</p>

<p>e. The Law of Exposure</p>

<p>In a marriage, as in no other relationship, the need for revealing your boundaries is important. Passive ways of showing people that they do not have control over you never lead to intimacy.</p>

<p>Boundaries need to be communicated first verbally and then with actions. They need to be clear and unapologetic.</p>

<p>SKIN: Each spouse needs to respect the other&rsquo;s physical body boundaries. (1 Cor. 7:4-6)</p>

<p>WORDS: Your words need to be clear and spoken in love. Confront your spouse directly. Say no. Don&rsquo;t use passive resistance.</p>

<p>TRUTH: (Eph. 4:25) Honest communication is always best. You also need to own the truth about your feelings and hurts and communicate those feelings directly to your spouse with love.</p>

<p>PHYSICAL SPACE: When you need time away, tell your spouse. Communicate clearly so your spouse does not feel as though he is being punished, but knows he is experiencing the consequences of his out-of-control behavior. (Matt. 18:17; 1 Cor. 5:9-13)</p>

<p>EMOTIONAL DISTANCE: If you are in a troubled marriage, you may need emotional space. Waiting to trust again is wise. You need to see if your spouse is truly repentant, and your spouse needs to see that their behavior has a cost. The Bible teaches that we are to judge a person by their actions, not by their words (James 2:14-16).</p>

<p>In addition, a hurt heart takes time to heal. If you are hurting, you need to own that hurt.</p>

<p>TIME: Each spouse needs time apart from the relationship. Not just for limit setting, but for self-nourishment. Each had their own time for doing what they like and for seeing their own friends. Many couples have trouble with this aspect of marriage. In reality, spouses need time apart, which makes them realize the need to be back together. Spouses in healthy relationships cherish each other&rsquo;s space and are champions of each other&rsquo;s causes.</p>

<p>OTHER PEOPLE: Some spouses need the support of others to set boundaries. If they have not ever stood up for themselves, they need help from friends and the church in learning how. Get help from other people within relationships that have built-in boundaries, such as counselors or support groups.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES: Communicate consequences clearly and enforce them firmly as you have said you would. Spelling out consequences in advance and enforcing them gives your spouse a choice about whether or not they want the consequences to happen. Because people have control over their own behavior, they have control over the consequences of that behavior.</p>

<p>3. But that does not sound submissive.</p>

<p>Whenever we talk about a wife setting boundaries, someone asks about the biblical idea of submission.</p>

<p>First, both husbands and wives are supposed to practice submission, not just wives. (Eph. 5:21) Christ&rsquo;s relationship with the church is a picture of how a husband and wife should relate (Eph. 5:24-27)</p>

<p>Many marital problems arise when a husband tries to keep his wife &ldquo;under the law&rdquo;, and she feels all the emotions the Bible promises the law will bring &ndash; wrath, guilt, insecurity, and alienation (Rom. 4:15; James 2:10; Gal. 5:4). Freedom is one issue that needs to be examined; grace is another.</p>

<p>(Eph. 5:28-29) Christ never takes away our will or asks us to do something hurtful. He never pushes us past our limits. He never uses us as objects. Christ &ldquo;gave himself up&rdquo; for us. He takes care of us as he would his own body.</p>

<p>We have never seen a &ldquo;submission problem&rdquo; that did not have a controlling husband at its root. When the wife begins to set clear boundaries, the lack of Christlikeness in a controlling husband becomes evident because the wife is no longer enabling his immature behavior. Often, when the wife sets boundaries, the husband begins to grow up.</p>

<p>4. A question of balance.</p>

<p>Every marriage is made up of two ingredients, togetherness, and separateness. In good marriages, the partners carry equal loads of both of those.</p>

<p>Balance is something that God has wired into every system.</p>

<p>Boundaries help create mutual balance instead of split balance. They help couples keep each other accountable. Boundaries keep partners accountable through consequences and force the balance to become mutual. (Eccl. 3:1)</p>

<p>5. Resolution.</p>

<p>It is often easy to see the problems but difficult to make the hard choices and risks that result in change.</p>

<p>Inventory the symptom. First, you need to recognize the problem and agree to take action to solve it.</p>

<p>Identify the specific boundary problem. One step beyond identifying the symptom is putting your finger on the specific boundary issue.</p>

<p>Find the origins of the conflict. You probably learned to relate this way in a significant relationship in the family in which you grew up.</p>

<p>Take in the good. This step involves establishing a support system. Establish a support system that will encourage boundary setting in your marriage. Do not set boundaries alone. (Eccl. 4:12) Boundaries need to be built up in a safe support system and allowed to grow.</p>

<p>Practice. Practice new boundaries in safe relationships, relationships in which people love you unconditionally.</p>

<p>Say no to the bad. Put limits on the bad in your marriage. Stand up to abuse; say no to unreasonable demands.</p>

<p>Forgive. Not to forgive is to lack boundaries. Unforgiving people allow other people to control them. Forgiving can lead to proactive behavior in the present instead of passive wishes from the past.</p>

<p>Become proactive. Instead of allowing someone else to be in control, figure out what you want to do, set your course, and stick to it.</p>

<p>Learn to love in freedom and responsibility. Remember the goal of boundaries: love coming out of freedom. (John 15:13) This is to live up to the law of Christ, to serve one another. But this must be done out of freedom, not boundaryless compliance.</p>

<p>Setting and receiving firm boundaries with your spouse can lead to much greater intimacy.</p>

<p>C. Boundaries and your children.</p>

<p>Of all the areas in which boundaries are crucially important, none is more relevant than that of raising children. How we approach boundaries and child rearing will have an enormous impact on the characters of our kids. On how they develop values. On how well they do in school. On the friends they pick. On whom they marry. And so how well they do in a career.</p>

<p>1. The importance of family</p>

<p>God, at his deepest level, is a lover (1 John 4:8). He is relationally oriented and relationally driven. He desires connection with us from womb to tomb: &ldquo;I have loved you with an everlasting love&rdquo; (Jer. 31:3).</p>

<p>The family is the social unit God invented to fill up the world with representatives of his loving character.</p>

<p>God first picked the nation of Israel to be his children. After centuries of resistance by Israel, however, God chose the church: &ldquo;Because of [Israel&rsquo;s] transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious&rdquo; (Rom. 11:11). Believers &ldquo;are members of [God&rsquo;s] household&rdquo; (Eph. 2:19).</p>

<p>God is a daddy. He likes his job.</p>

<p>2. Boundaries and responsibility</p>

<p>God, the good parent, wants to help us, his children, grow up (Eph. 4:13).</p>

<p>Second only to learning how to bond, to form strong attachments, the most important thing parents can give children is a sense of responsibility &ndash; knowing what they are responsible for and knowing what they are not responsible for, knowing how to say no and knowing how to accept no. Responsibility is a gift of enormous value. (The relearning process for adults is laborious.)</p>

<p>3. Instilling vs. repairing boundaries</p>

<p>Developing boundaries in young children is that proverbial ounce of prevention. If we teach responsibility, limit setting, and delay of gratification early on, the smoother our children&rsquo;s later years of life will be.</p>

<p>If you are a parent of older children, do not lose heart. It just means boundary development will be met with more resistance.</p>

<p>4. Boundary development in children</p>

<p>The work of boundary development in children is the work of learning responsibility. As we teach them the merits and limits of responsibility, we teach them autonomy &ndash; we prepare them to take on the tasks of adulthood.</p>

<p>The Hebrew and Greek words that scholars translate as &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; mean &ldquo;teaching&rdquo;. The positive facets of discipline are proactivity, prevention, and instruction. (Eph. 6:4) The negative facets of discipline are correction, chastisement, and consequences. Negative discipline is letting children suffer the results of their actions to learn a lesson in responsibility. (Prov. 15:10)</p>

<p>Good child rearing involves both preventive training and practice, and correctional consequences.</p>

<p>Why are both positive and negative discipline necessary in good boundary development? Because God uses practice &ndash; trial and error &ndash; to help us grow up. We learn maturity by getting information, applying it poorly, making mistakes, learning from our mistakes, and doing better the next time.</p>

<p>Practice is necessary in all areas of life: in learning to ski, write an essay, or operate a computer. We need practice in developing a deep love relationship and in learning to study the Bible. (Heb. 5:14) Practice is important in learning boundaries and responsibility. Our mistakes are our teachers.</p>

<p>Discipline is an external boundary, designed to develop internal boundaries in our children. It provides a structure of safety until children have enough structure in their character not to need it.</p>

<p>We need to distinguish between discipline and punishment. Punishment is payment for wrongdoing. Punishment does not leave a lot of room for practice. It&rsquo;s not a great teacher. The price is too high (Rom. 6:23 and James 2:10).</p>

<p>Discipline is different. Discipline is not payment for a wrong. It&rsquo;s the natural law of God: our actions reap consequences. Discipline is different from punishment because God is finished punishing us. Punishment ended on the cross for all those who accept Christ. (1 Peter 2:24) Christ&rsquo;s suffering paid for our wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Discipline and punishment had a different relationship with time. Punishment looks back. It focuses on payment for wrongs done in the past. Discipline, however, looks forward. The lessons we learn from discipline help us not to make the same mistakes again (Heb. 12:10).</p>

<p>This frees us to make mistakes, without fear of judgment, without fear of loss of relationship. (Rom 8:1) The only danger is consequences &ndash; not isolation and judgment.</p>

<p>5. The boundary needs of children</p>

<p>Limit-setting abilities have several important jobs that will pay enormous dividends throughout life.</p>

<p>Self-Protection</p>

<p>God designed the newborn months as a means for the mother and father (or another caregiver) to connect deeply with their infant, knowing that without their minute-by-minute care, the baby would not survive.</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s program of maturation, however, does not stop there. Mom and Dad cannot always be there to care and provide. The task of protection needs to ultimately pass on to the children. When they grow up, they need to protect themselves.</p>

<p>Boundaries are our way of protecting and safeguarding our souls. Boundaries are designed to keep the good in and the bad out. And skills such as saying no, telling the truth, and maintaining physical distance need to be developed in the family structure to allow the child to take on the responsibility of self-protection.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the teens are a crucible for kids. That is when we find out what kind of character has actually been built into our children during this difficult passage.</p>

<p>Taking Responsibility for One&rsquo;s Needs</p>

<p>Some children spend most of their childhood taking responsibility for their parents&rsquo; feelings as the peacemaker of the house. The result of such unbiblical responsibility is a sense of over-responsibility for others and a lack of attunement toward their own needs. They have a hard time understanding their own God-given, legitimate needs.</p>

<p>The second fruit of boundary development in our children is the ability to take ownership of, or responsibility for, our own needs. God intends for us to know what we need and then to take initiative to get what we need.</p>

<p>Jesus left a crowd of people in a boat in a time of great ministry and need &ldquo;because so many people were coming and going that [he and his disciples] did not even have a chance to eat.&rdquo; (Mark 6:31)</p>

<p>Our limits create a spiritual and emotional space, a separateness, between ourselves and others. This allows our needs to be heard and understood. Without a solid sense of boundaries, it becomes difficult to filter out our needs from those of others. There is too much static in the relationship.</p>

<p>When children can be taught to experience their own needs, as opposed to those of others, they have been given a genuine advantage in life. They are able to better avoid the burnout that comes from not taking care of oneself.</p>

<p>The best thing a parent can do is to encourage verbal expression of those needs. When children have permission to ask for something that goes against the grain &ndash; even though they might not receive it &ndash; they develop a sense of what they need.</p>

<p>Below are some ways you can help your children:</p>

<p>- Allow them to talk about their anger</p>

<p>- Allow them to express grief, loss, or sadness without trying to cheer them up and talk them out of their feelings.</p>

<p>- Encourage them to ask questions and not assume your words are the equivalent of Scripture (this takes a pretty secure parent!)</p>

<p>- Ask them what they are feeling when they seem isolated or distressed; help them put words to their negative feelings. Do not try to keep things light for a false sense of cooperation and family closeness.</p>

<p>The first aspect of taking ownership of one&rsquo;s needs, then, is to identify them.</p>

<p>The second aspect of taking ownership is to initiate responsible caretaking for ourselves &ndash; as opposed to placing the burden on consequences of their own irresponsibility and mistakes. This is the &ldquo;training&rdquo; of Hebrews 5:14 and the &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; of Hebrews 12:4-11.</p>

<p>By the time they leave home, our children should have internalized a deep sense of personal responsibility for their lives. They should hold these convictions:</p>

<p>- My success or failure in life largely depends on me.</p>

<p>- Though I am to look to God and others for comfort and instruction, I alone am responsible for my choices.</p>

<p>- Though I am deeply affected by my significant relationships throughout life, I cannot blame my problems on anyone but myself.</p>

<p>- Though I will always fail and need support, I can&rsquo;t depend on some over-responsible individual to constantly bail me out of spiritual, emotional, financial, or relational crisis.</p>

<p>This sense of &ldquo;my life is up to me&rdquo; is founded in God&rsquo;s concern that we take responsibility for our lives. He wants us to use our talents in productive ways (Matt. 25:14-30).</p>

<p>This is not to say that we are not deeply influenced for better or worse by our backgrounds and our various stressors. We certainly are. But we are ultimately responsible for what we do with our injured, immature souls.</p>

<p>Wise parents allow their children to undergo &ldquo;safe suffering.&rdquo; This means allowing a child to experience age-appropriate consequences. It is important to tie consequences as closely as possible to the actions of the child. This best replicates real life.</p>

<p>Why do we do this? Because we love our kids. We long for the best for them just as God longs for the best for us. And yet, just as God allows us to experience our failures, we may need to let our kids mar a good report card with a bad grade.</p>

<p>Having a Sense of Control and Choice</p>

<p>Children need to have a sense of control and choice in their lives. They need to see themselves not as the dependent, helpless pawns of parents but as choosing, willing, initiative-taking agents of their own lives.</p>

<p>Learning to make age-appropriate decisions helps children have a sense of security and control in their lives.</p>

<p>Anxious and well-meaning parents attempt to prevent their children from making painful decisions. The result is that kids become atrophied in a particularly important part of the image of God that should be developing in their character: their assertion, or change-making abilities.</p>

<p>Delaying Gratification of Goals</p>

<p>The word now was made for young children. Newborns, in fact, don&rsquo;t have the capacity to understand &ldquo;later.&rdquo; That is why a six-months old panics when Mom leaves the room.</p>

<p>Yet sometime in our development we learn the value of &ldquo;later&rdquo;, of delaying one good for a greater good. We call this skill delay of gratification. It is the ability to say no to our impulses, wishes, and desires for some gain down the road.</p>

<p>The Scriptures place great value on this ability. God uses this skill to help us see the benefits of planning and preparing. Jesus is our prime example: &ldquo;For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God&rdquo; (Heb. 12:2).</p>

<p>Again, the boundaries developed during this process are invaluable later in life. They can prevent a child from becoming an adult who is broken, chaotic, impulse-driven slave to the shopping street. Our children can become like ants, who are self-sufficient, instead of sluggards, who are always in crisis (Prov. 6:6-11).</p>

<p>Learning how to delay gratification helps children have a goal orientation. They learn to save time and money for things that are important to them, and they value what they have chosen to buy (Luke 14:28).</p>

<p>Respecting the Limits of Others</p>

<p>From an early age, children need to be able to accept the limits of parents, siblings, and friends. They need to know that the world does not revolve around them.</p>

<p>This is important for a couple of reasons:</p>

<p>First, the ability to learn to accept limits teaches us to take responsibility for ourselves. It helps us carry our own knapsack. The longer we hate and resist the limits of others, the more dependent we will be on others, and that is a problem. Rather than simply taking care of ourselves, we expect others to take care of us.</p>

<p>God has constructed life itself to teach us this law. Sooner or later, someone will say a no to us that we cannot ignore. It is built into the fabric of life.</p>

<p>Observe the progression of nos in the life of the person who resists others&rsquo; limits:</p>

<p> - the no of parents</p>

<p> - the no of siblings</p>

<p> - the no of school teachers</p>

<p> - the no of school friends</p>

<p> - the no of bosses and supervisors</p>

<p> - the no of spouses</p>

<p> - the no of health problems from overeating, alcoholism, or an irresponsible lifestyle</p>

<p> - the no of police, the courts, and even prison</p>

<p>No matter how though we think we are, there is always someone tougher. If we do not teach our children to take a no, someone who loves them far less may take on the job. The earlier we teach limits, the better.</p>

<p>A second, even more important, reason why accepting the limits of others is important for kids is this: heeding others&rsquo; boundaries helps children to love. At its heart, the idea of respecting others&rsquo; boundaries is the basis for empathy, or loving others as we would like to be loved. Children need to be given the grace of having their no respected, and they need to learn to give that same grace to others. As they feel empathy for the needs of others, they mature and deepen in their love for God and others: &ldquo;We love because he first loved us&rdquo; (1 John 4:19).</p>

<p>If this principle is not taught, it is difficult for children to grow up as loving people. Frequently they become self-centered or controlling.</p>

<p>6. Seasonal boundaries: Age-appropriate limits training</p>

<p>Your newborn will not stop shrieking. Your toddler runs the household. Your elementary school student has behavioral problems at school. Your junior high kid smarts off. Your high schooler is drinking.</p>

<p>All of these issues indicate possible boundary problems.</p>

<p>Here is an outline of age-appropriate boundary tasks your children should be learning.</p>

<p>Birth to Five Months</p>

<p>At this stage, the newborn needs to establish an attachment with Mother, Father, or the primary caregiver. A sense of belonging, of being safe and welcome are the tasks the child needs to accomplish. Setting limits is not as much an issue here as providing security for the infant. (ex.: swaddling. Mary swaddled Jesus)</p>

<p>A screaming four-month-old child is trying to find out whether the world is a reasonably safe place or not. She is in a state of deep terror and isolation. They have not learned to feel comfort when no one is around.</p>

<p>Teaching delay of gratification should not begin until after the first year of life, when a foundation of safety has been established between baby and mother. Just as grace always precedes truth (John 1:17), attachment must come before separation.</p>

<p>Five to Ten Months</p>

<p>Though they have tremendous dependency needs, infants are beginning to move out of their oneness with their mom.</p>

<p>To help their children develop good boundaries during this stage, parents need to encourage attempts at separateness, while still being the anchors the child clings to.</p>

<p>Helping your children hatch, however, does not mean neglecting the deep attachment necessary for their internal foundation, their rootedness and groundedness.</p>

<p>Many mothers find this transition from their child&rsquo;s love affair with them to the big wide world difficult. The responsible mother, however, will strive to get her own closeness needs met by other adults in her life.</p>

<p>Ten to Eighteen Months</p>

<p>At this &ldquo;practicing&rdquo; stage, your baby begins not only talking but also walking. The world is this child&rsquo;s oyster &ndash; and she spends a lot of time finding ways to open it up and play with it. Now she has the emotional and cognitive ability to understand and respond to the word no.</p>

<p>Boundaries &ndash; both having and hearing limits &ndash; become increasingly important during this stage. Allowing the &ldquo;no&rdquo; muscle to begin developing is crucial at this age. As parents, learn to rejoice in your baby&rsquo;s no.</p>

<p>At the same time, you have the delicate task of helping your child see that she is not the center of the universe.</p>

<p>Eighteen to Thirty-Six Months</p>

<p>The child is now learning the important task of taking responsibility for a separate yet connected soul.</p>

<p>In this phase, the following abilities are goals:</p>

<p>- The ability to be emotionally attached to others without giving up a sense of self and one&rsquo;s freedom to be apart.</p>

<p>- The ability to say appropriate nos to others without fear of loss of love.</p>

<p>- The ability to take appropriate nos from others without withdrawing emotionally.</p>

<p>At eighteen to thirty-six months, the child needs to learn to be autonomous. The wise parent will help her gain a sense of individualism and accept her loss of omnipotence, but without losing attachment.</p>

<p>To teach a child boundaries at this stage, you need to respect her no whenever appropriate yet maintain your own firm no. Pick your battles carefully and chooses the important ones to win. Wise parents will rejoice in children&rsquo;s fun times but will consistently and uniformly keep solid limits with the practicing child.</p>

<p>One workable process of discipline is listed below:</p>

<p> 1. First Infraction. Tell the child no (ex. Not coloring on the bedsheet).</p>

<p> 2. Second Infraction. Again, tell the child no, and state the consequence.</p>

<p> 3. Third Infraction. Administer the consequences, explaining why.</p>

<p> 4. Comfort and Reconnection. Hold and comfort the child, helping them to reattach with you. Painful consequences should never include a loss of connection.</p>

<p>Three to Five Years</p>

<p>During this phase, children move into a period of sex-role development. Most children identify with the same-sex parent. They also develop competitive feelings towards that same parent, wishing to marry the opposite-sex parent.</p>

<p>Boundary work by parents is important here. Parents should allow the expression of these competitive feelings while gently affirming that they are married to each other and so what the child wants cannot be. This helps children identify with the opposite-sex parent and take on appropriate characteristics.</p>

<p>Parents who fear the budding sexuality of their children will often become critical of these intense longings. Their own fear may cause them to attack or to shame their child, causing them to repress their sexuality. At the other extreme, the needy parent will sometimes emotionally, or even physically, seduce the child of the opposite sex.</p>

<p>Mature parents need to keep a boundary between allowing sex role typing to emerge &ndash; and keeping the lines clear between parent and child.</p>

<p>Six to Eleven Years</p>

<p>During what is called latency, or the years of industry, the child is preparing for the upcoming thrust into adolescence. These years are the last true years of childhood. They are important for learning task orientation through schoolwork and play, and for learning to connect with same-sex peers.</p>

<p>Here the parents need to help their child establish the fundamentals of tasks: doing homework, doing house chores, and projects. They need to learn planning and the discipline of keeping at a job until it is finished. They need to learn such boundary work as delay of gratification, goal orientation, and budgeting of time.</p>

<p>Eleven to Eighteen Years</p>

<p>Adolescence, the final step before adulthood, involves important tasks such as sexual maturation, a sense of solidifying identity in any surrounding, career learnings, and love choices.</p>

<p>By this point, the &ldquo;deparenting&rdquo; process should have begun. Instead of controlling your child, you influence them. You increase their freedom, as well as responsibility. You renegotiate restrictions, limits, and consequences with more flexibility.</p>

<p>You are preparing for the launching of a young adult into the world. Wise parents always keep the imminent catapulting of their teens into society in the back of their minds. The question they must struggle with is &ldquo;How can I help them survive on their own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Teens need to be setting their own relational, scheduling, values, and money boundaries as much as possible. And they should suffer real-life consequences when they cross their boundaries.</p>

<p>Pay attention to these symptoms as they may indicate a more serious problem:</p>

<p>- isolation of the teen from family members</p>

<p>- depressed mood</p>

<p>- rebellious behavior</p>

<p>- continual conflict in family</p>

<p>- wrong type of friends</p>

<p>- school problems</p>

<p>- eating disorders</p>

<p>- alcohol use</p>

<p>- drug use</p>

<p>- suicidal ideas or behavior</p>

<p>Should you see these types of behaviors as a parent, you should consider consulting a therapist who understands teen issues.</p>

<p>7. Types of discipline</p>

<p>Many parents are confused by how to teach children to respect boundaries. Here are a few thoughts that may help organize the searching parent.</p>

<p>a. Consequences are intended to increase children&rsquo;s sense of responsibility and control over their lives. A system of rewards and consequences that help them choose school for their own benefit has much better possibilities for success.</p>

<p>b. Consequences must be age appropriate. Think through the meaning of your discipline.</p>

<p>c. Consequences must be related to the seriousness of the infraction. &ldquo;Once you&rsquo;ve been sentenced to death, you do not have much to gain by being good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>d. The goal of boundaries is an internal sense of motivation, with self-induced consequences. It&rsquo;s only when love and limits are a genuine part of the child&rsquo;s character that true maturity can occur.</p>

<p>Parents have a sober responsibility: teaching their children to have an internal sense of boundaries and to respect the boundaries of others. (James 3:1) Children have the responsibility to listen and learn.</p>

<p>Questions to work on:</p>

<p>What guides the decisions you make? Do you choose out of love or guilt? Do you choose to advance a good or to avoid being bad? Give examples and be honest with yourself about your motives.</p>

<p>If you are married, are you please with the boundaries your spouse maintains with his/her family of origin? Or do you feel like you get leftovers?</p>

<p>What did your family of origin teach you about resolving conflict and dealing with anger?</p>

<p>Where do boundary problems exist with your parents and/or your siblings?</p>

<p>What needs did your family of origin not meet for you? Your need, for instance, to be loved? Approved of? Accepted? Understood? Free to be yourself?</p>

<p>Prayer</p>

<p>Heavenly Father, you designed families as a place for us to learn about you and your love &ndash; but families do not always teach us that. You know the dysfunction, the pain, and the untruths we can learn instead. You know the patterns of the family I grew up in, and what I did not learn about boundaries that I need to learn now. Teach me. Help me to clearly define my boundaries and to do a better job maintaining them. Give me the courage and wisdom to take steps toward resolving my boundary problems with my family. I pray in Jesus&rsquo; name. Amen.</p>
