            1. WHO DISCOVERED AMERICA?
            „Mundus Novus“ first coined by Amerigo Vespucci. Vespucci's letter sets the hypothesis that the lands discovered by European navigators to the west were not the edges of Asia, as asserted by Christopher Columbus, but an entirely different continent.
            The Old World (contrast with, the New World (Americas): Africa, Europe, and Asia (the world known to Europeans before contact with the Americas). 
            The idea of a glorious earthly paradise far from the known world had existed in the European imagination long before the discovery of America. That idea of a distant paradise on earth shaped the way Europeans came to think of America after Columbus and his successors reported their discoveries.
            2. Who discovered the New World? How did it come to be known?
            - Leif Eriksson: a Norse explorer (10th century). Historical debate - his landing was accidental or he had sailed there intentionally after learning of the region from earlier explorers.
            - Christopher Columbus: he discovered the "New World" of the Americas on an expedition sponsored by Spain in 1492. He was the one to open up the Americas to European colonization. Muslim domination of the trade routes through the Middle East made travel to India and China difficult. Believing a route sailing west across the Atlantic would be quicker and safer, Columbus devised a plan to sail west to reach the East.  After 36 days of sailing, Columbus and several crewmen set foot on an island in the present day Bahamas, claiming it for Spain. Columbus supposed at last he had reached the opulent land of the Indies, and so called the natives Indians. But it was an island, not a continent or an Asiatic empire, he had found.	Modern critics of Columbus assert that his treatment of the Indians showed a disregard for their natural rights.
            OTHER EXPLORERS
            The explorers and conquerors of the New World were undoubtedly courageous discoverers who ventured to face the unknown. Sometimes they were motivated by spreading Christianity and sometimes by greed and hopes for power and eternal youth. . The conquerors believed in the physical, mental and cultural inferiority of the conquered and thought that it was their obligation, as superior, to make better use of the land and its resources. The exploration of the New World yields insight into both the best and worst of mankind. -America was a land of equal opportunity, unfettered by the social, economic and class traditions of Europe, and individual advancement was a more realistic possibility. 
            -John Cabot - credited with discovering the North American continent. He made a British claim to land in Canada mistaking it for Asia in 1497. He is considered to be the reason why North Americans speak English. He believed that Native Americans could be transformed into Englishmen.
            - Henry Hudson discovered Hudson Bay. 
           -  Sir Walter Raleigh, famous for his efforts in colonizing Virginia.

            2. THE NATIVE AMERICANS
            Most of the Native American tribes living on the territory of present-day
            USA have never had an alphabet of their own. In 1821 a half-Cherokee
            Indian named Sequoya invented a syllabary for the purposes of his own
            tribe. The only complete writing system in the ancient New World was the
            Maya script. By the time the white settlers set foot on the North American
            continent, the native tribes had developed a rich oral tradition of lore –
            myths, legends, tales, songs, prayers, rituals, speeches and spells. Each
            had a distinctive way of expressing itself in poetry and prose. What they
            had in common was their reverence for nature, in which they lived in
            harmony and balance, and a worldview, in which the oneness of the
            objective material world with the subjective spiritual world was achieved
            through the immanent presence of the Great spirit. There is hardly a tribe
            that has not got a Creation myth of its own, which shows humankind’s
            undying longing and curiosity to know its origins, the meaning of its
            existence and destiny. A common feature of the Creation myth of the North
            American tribes is the belief that the universe and the world of mankind
            did not emerge from nothingness but through the wish and benevolence of a
            Power which is itself all-pervasive and limitless in Time and Space. The
            world of the Indians is suffused with poetry. Their songs are an
            expression of their innermost being and of their intimate relationship to
            the forces of nature and the universe. There are songs of healing and of
            growth, songs of vision and of dream, death songs and war songs,
            initiation and individual songs. Their poetry serves practical ends. It
            helps the singer to renew his/her own spiritual power, to enhance the
            power of all those natural and supernatural phenomena and forces which
            induce growth and life, and continually to reestablish his/her harmonious
            relationship with them, with his/her fellowmen, and with his/her own inner
            self.

            3. CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH (1580 – 1631) It was not
            until 1607 that the British – led by Captain John Smith – set in motion
            the irreversible process of colonization by establishing the first
            permanent settlement of about one hundred people in Jamestown, Virginia.
            This was followed by that of the Pilgrims in Plymouth (1620), later part
            of the Massachusetts Bay colony (founded 1628 – 30) in what became known
            as New England. Smith produced some of the most detailed reports about
            early Virginia. Recent archaeology has confirmed some of his most famous
            details. He died in England in 1631 at age 51 and is known as the first
            English writer in America. He produced some of the most detailed reports
            about early Virginia: A True Relation of Such Occurrences and Accidents of
            Note as Happened in Virginia (1608) – considered to be THE FIRST ENGLISH
            WORK WRITTEN IN AMERICA: Describes the interactions of the colonists with
            different Native American tribes beginning with the battle upon arrival in
            Jamestown; Details Smith’s exploration of the land and involvement with
            different tribes and tribal leaders, which resulted in trading practices
            that sustained the colony; Notes that Powhatan and his people sent deer,
            bread, corn, turkeys, and other supplies during Smith’s stay in the
            colony; Describes how he was captured, injured, and rescued from certain
            Native American tribes; Internal fighting, sickness, and changes in
            leadership plagued the colony, but Smith ended the relation with optimism
            concerning its survival. This work was first published under the
            title True Relation on 13 August 1608.  Map of Virginia (1612)  Generall
            Historie of Virginia, (New-England, and the Summer Isles)  – first
            published in 1624, it is about: - The rough beginning of the Jamestown
            Colony; - The severe conditions of sea travellers; - The challenges of
            living with Native Americans; - Smith’s romance with Pocahontas. A

            Observations of Captain John Smith (1630)

             4. COLONIAL LITERATURE
             COLONIAL LITERATURE
THE NORTHERN COLONIES: The New England colonies in the north were populated mainly by newly arrived Puritans, English Protestants who had initially emigrated from England to Holland because of disagreements with the Orthodox Church of England. They succeeded in establishing a thriving and diversified economy in the north and made a substantial contribution to the development of political practices and social beliefs. Indeed, their belief in government by contract from the governed was to prove decisive in influencing New England principles concerning the value of individual freedom and democracy. They also believed strongly in the importance of hard work (conveyed dignity on man and ensured him of a place in God’s favour) and education (Harvard and Yale colleges). They were particularly strict on matters concerning morality and religion. Indeed, the society they built up in the northern colonies was highly theocratic: civil government officials were chosen from among those members of the church who most ardently adhered to the principles of the Old Testament, and who were regular churchgoers. Religious intolerance and persecution were not unknown in Massachusetts (the hanging of 19 people suspected of witchcraft in Salem). 

MIDDLE COLONIES: Pennsylvania was chartered to William Penn. Penn was a member of a much persecuted religious group called the Quakers seeking freedom from persecution. Pennsylvania flourished and its capital city, Philadelphia, rapidly became America’s largest city.
THE SOUTHERN COLONIES: (Carolina settled by British settlers and French Protestants (Huguenots). The rice and indigo plantations in South Carolina required a substantial work force, and many African-Americans were imported to work as slaves . Plantations and African slaves made up an essential part of a flourishing economy. In contrast to the north, life was more rural. Large and self-sufficient estates, plantations and mansions formed the social backbone of southern life (more fun-loving and tolerant).

THE POPULATION OF AMERICA: By the 1750s America had become a ‘melting pot’ in terms of both religion and race. (Puritans, Quakers and Huguenots, Catholics, Jews, Africans). In the beginning Africans were passed into servitude – or ‘indentured’ – for a limited number of years, but then extended to indefinitely. Hence the beginning of true slavery in America.
            Americans had to wait until mid 19th century for a rich and imaginative literature. Most colonists were chiefly engaged in making a home of the wilderness they had discovered on America’s shores. The literature of this period is of more historical than literary interest to the modern reader. It is made up of historical and religious journals, letters, speeches, sermons and public documents.       Prose in the colonial period was dominated by the work of New Englanders whose religious writings formed the great bulk of early American literature. The quest for spiritual identity in the New World persuaded them to write serious and responsible works which often contained some kind of moral purpose. Its declared function was to instruct. Sermons and religious pamphlets dealt with the themes of religious tolerance, and other ecclesiastical controversies. A strong Puritanical or Calvinistic strain ran through much of these works.     The literature of the Colonial period: 1. prose connected with history and geography, 2. religious writing and 3. colonial poetry.

PROSE CONNECTED WITH HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY:            The other main concern of prose writers was to describe the history and geography of the newly settled territories. Accounts of the first pioneers and their various activities took the form of newsletters, journals, letters that provide us with an interesting picture of early colonial life. The first English writer in America was Captain John Smith whose A True Relation is a straightforward and precise historical account of the Jamestown settlement. He also wrote  “The General History of Virginia”.
          Other writers: John Winthrop’s Journal described life in the Massachusetts Bay colony and his advocating of theocratic state.  This wass echoed by Bradford in his “The History of Plymouth Plantation” - an account of the Pilgrim Fathers and their foundation of the Plymouth colony. Penn’s “Some Account of the Province of Pennsylvania” was in part an attempt to publicize the opportunities offered by life in Pennsylvania. Byrd was a Virginia planter and agent for the colony: his “History of the Dividing Line” was a witty and satirical account of the boundary survey between north and south. 

RELIGIOUS WRITERS:          The Puritan Mather was the most versatile and prolific writer of the age (his writings deal with theological issues). Wonders of the Invisible World defends Mather's role in the witch hunt conducted in Salem. Mather saw witches as tools of the devil in Satan's battle to "overturn this poor plantation, the Puritan colony", and prosecution of witches as a way to secure God's blessings for the colony. Mather’s most important work was Magnalia Christi Americana, a two-volume ecclesiastical history of New England. His Christian Philosopher recognizes God in the wonders of the earth and the universe beyond; it is both philosophical and scientific and, ironically, anticipates 18th-century Deism, despite his clinging to the old order.
      Jonathan Edwards was a Calvinist preacher in Massachusetts. As a leader of the religious revival movement known as the Great Awakening, he struck the fear of God into the hearts of his congregation with fiery sermons. His most famous work was Freedom of Will (1754), an influential philosophical treatise written in defence of Calvinistic doctrine. 
             
COLONIAL POETRY:         Colonial poetry was mainly of a religious nature . The first book to be published in the colonies was the “Bay Psalm Book”, a collection of psalms in verse from intended for group singing in the churches. The “New England Primer”, America’s first text book. Despite Puritan doubts and suspicions about the value of poetry (it was too sensuous and lacked a true instructional element), heavily Puritanical elegies and epitaphs were composed to honour the dead.
       The Puritan poet thinks of himself as fallen from Adam, as an individual, that distinctness that individuality, is all contaminated with the story of self-assertion and corruption he inherited from Adam. And so a poet who thinks himself in this way, thinks of himself as sinful.
                 Other colonial poets: Anne Bradstreet, Michael Wigglesworth, and Edward Taylor.  Wigglesworth’s heavily Calvinistic ballad style in “The Day of Doom” was the most popular literary work of colonial times and took its place on most Puritan bookshelves beside the Bible and Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress. The most important poet of the period was, however, Edward Taylor- a fierce Puritan, his poems show the influence of the English Metaphysicals.

        <p> 5. THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR (THE US WAR OF INDEPENDENCE) 
          American Revolution
          For more than a decade before the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, tensions had been building between colonists and the British authorities. Attempts by the British government to raise revenue by taxing the colonies (the  Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend Tariffs of 1767 and the Tea Act of 1773) met with heated protest among many colonists, who resented their lack of representation in Parliament and demanded the same rights as other British subjects. Colonial resistance led to violence in 1770, when British soldiers opened fire on a mob of colonists, killing five men in what was known as the Boston Massacre. After December 1773, when a band of Bostonians dressed as Mohawk Indians boarded British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor, an outraged Parliament passed a series of measures (known as the Intolerable, or Coercive Acts) designed to reassert imperial authority in Massachusetts.
          Stamp Act of 1765: was the first internal tax, imposed a tax on all paper documents in the colonies. 
          The Tea Act of 1773. The act’s gave the East India Companya monopoly on the importation and sale of tea in the colonies. Resistance culminated in the Boston Tea Party, in which colonists dumped the loads of tea overboard. 
          the Intolerable, or Coercive Acts: a series of measures designed to reassert imperial authority.
          The American Revolution, which had begun as a civil conflict between Britain and its colonies, had become a world war.
          By June 1776 the Revolutionary War was in full swing. 
          On July 4th 1776, the Continental Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence, drafted by a five-man committee including Franklin and John Adams but written mainly by Jefferson. 
          
          UK formally recognized the independence of the United States in the Treaty of Paris in 1783.
          
          The Founding Fathers of the United States are the individuals of the Thirteen British Colonies in North America who led the American Revolution against the authority of the British Crown and established the United States of America. The term is also used more narrowly, referring specifically to those who either signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 or who were delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention and took part in drafting the proposed Constitution of the United States. A further subset includes those who signed the Continental Association or the Articles of Confederation.[2] During much of the 19th century, they were referred to as either the "Founders" or the "Fathers".
          Some historians apply the term "Founding Fathers" to a larger group of people, including not only the Signers and the Framers but also all those who, whether as politicians, jurists, statesmen, soldiers, diplomats, or ordinary citizens, took part in winning American independence and creating the United States of America.[3] Historian Richard B. Morris in 1973 identified the following seven figures as the key Founding Fathers: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington.[4] Adams, Jefferson, and Franklin worked on the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. Hamilton, Madison, and Jay were authors of the The Federalist Papers, advocating ratification of the Constitution. Washington commanded the revolutionary army. All served in important positions in the early government of the United States.

            AMERICAN LITERATURE IN THE MID- TO LATE 18th CENTURY
            AMERICAN LITERATURE IN THE MID- TO LATE 18th CENTURY
When the war was finishing many American prose writers began abandoning early Puritanical concerns with religion and took to politics. In an age of increasing scientific rationalism, new ideas about equality and liberty circulated in Europe. A new and more educated American middle class, conscious of its national identity and less enslaved to the rigors of Puritanism, emerged during the mid 1700s. This was the age of the orator and pamphlet writer whose ‘literary’ efforts were to prove decisive in galvanizing public opinion behind the inevitable drive towards independence. 
Undoubtedly the two most prominent ‘literary’ figures of the times were Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine. FRANKLIN-Statesman, inventor, publisher and printer, he became a spokesman for American interests and declared his open hostility towards UK. He is chiefly remembered for his unfinished Autobiography, a highly influential rags to riches account of the ‘self made man’. The ‘Declaration of Independence’ (1776), perhaps the greatest expression of political liberty in prose, was drafted with the help of Franklin, although Thomas Jefferson must take most of the credit for its composition. Thomas Paine’s clear and forceful prose works, Common Sense  and The Crisis , were highly influential in encouraging and sustaining American morale during the War of Independence. His The Rights of Man defended the cause of the revolutionaries in France, although the principles it extols are of universal concern.
A group of poets called the ‘Connecticut Wits’ (John Trumbull, Timothy Dwight, David Humphreys and Joel Barlow) exhibited a desire for a new ‘national’ literature liberated from the trappings of European verse models, although much of their verse continued the tradition of English satire. 
THE NEW CONSTITUTION 
The 13 colonies of pre-revolutionary America were called ‘states’. George Washington, agreed to abandon the Articles of Confederation in favor of a new constitution.
This new constitution provided for both federal and state powers, and was divided up into three branches: executive;legislature (House of Reps and the Senate), and Judiciary. Washington became the first President of the United States in 1789. Two years later the Bill of Rights, a series of ten amendments to the Constitution, provided further guarantees with regard to individual rights, including the right to trial by jury and freedom of speech, religion and the press.
Thomas Jefferson
The 1790s saw the development of two political parties: Hamilton (north) formed the Federalist Party (favored strong federal government and support for UK). In the south, Jefferson established the Democratic Republican Party (a less centralized government and support France).  Jefferson became President. The ‘Jeffersonian democracy’, consisted of a firm belief in America as a nation of small farmers whose lives should be as little encumbered by central government as possible.
The Age of Reason
In place of revelation, myth, the Bible, and the miraculous, Paine substitutes nature to substantiate his religious beliefs. He acknowledges “that there is a power superior to all… God.” Yet he denies the traditional arguments of Christian theology. Aspects that make Paine’s style effective: 
Apt use of anecdote
Humor
Oversimplification
Effective metaphor and imagery
Rhetorical devices such as: alliteration, repetition, summary.

THE ‘ERA OF GOOD FEELING’
The peaceful period which followed the war is sometimes known as ‘The Era of Good Feeling’, imbued as it was with a spirit of unity, optimism and peace, and a form of economic protectionism known as the ‘American System’ (domestic manufacturers benefited from the tariffs on imports). This prevailing spirit of optimism and wellbeing was undermined by an issue which was later to prove decisive in affecting the course of events: slavery. 
LITERARY CONTEXT
Political independence preceded by a good number of years literary autonomy in the United States, and it was still to be some time before American writers were in a position to speak of a truly ‘national’ literature. English models continued to prevail, especially in the south, and writers found it difficult to compete with British authors, whose works were sold in inexpensive editions all over the country. There was a sense that other things were of greater importance than literature during this age of transition. General Washington argued that American genius was scientific rather than imaginative, a view which Franklin did much encourage.
An important landmark in the development of an independent cultural identity was the publication of the first American dictionary by Noah Webster. 
Only with Washington Irving did the United States gain its first truly internationally recognized author of prose. He established his reputation with a collection of satirical essays and poems on the inhabitants of Manhattan in The Salmagundi Papers. The Satirical Knickerbocker’s History of New York confirmed his talents, but it was with the publication of The Sketch Book ten years later that his international reputation was secured. While dealing with American themes, many of the essays and tales contained within his volume took their inspiration from old European folk stories: Rip Van Winkle and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow are among the most famous tales in his book. Thus Irving is credited with showing that the short story was the American literary form par excellence. 
The novel also made its first appearance in America during this period. William Hill Brown wrote an epistolary novel about tragic, incestuous love called Power of Sympathy. Close to the English novelist, Richardson, in its sentimental style, it was the first American novel to be published. Modelling his works on the Gothic novels of late eighteenth-century England, Charles Brockden Brown is the ‘Father of the American novel’. Horror and terror are characteristics of his works, the most famous of which are Wieland. 
William Bryant ,was known as the ‘American Wordsworth’. He was heavily influenced first by Pope and then by the English Romantics, in particular those of the so called ‘Graveyard School’. At the age of only 17 he wrote his most famous poem, Thanatopsis (Greek for ‘a view of death’).

        <p> 7. THE LITERATURE OF REASON AND REVOLUTION
          The 18th century in America – the Age of Reason, the Age of Neoclassicism, and the Age of Engligthenment.
          New men – scientists, religious rationalists, political philosophers – cool to organized religion and critical of governments.
          Ideas – rooted in the classical worlds of Greece and Rome, in the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation.
          The Age of Reason – developed first in the 17th century England, spread through France and Europe, and finally came to the English colonies in America in the 18th century.
          Descartes (1596 – 1727) – rejection of medieval authoritarianism.
          An age of great discoverers – Isaac Newton – revealed that the universe is not a mystery moving at the whim of an inscrutable God but a mechanism operating by a rational formula that can be understood by any intelligent man or woman.
          Men of the Age of Reason sought order everywhere in the natural world – and found it, not in religion but in the new science.
          Tomas Paine declared that proof of God is not to be found in the Bible but in nature, that perfect expression of God’s omnipotent goodness.
          Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine – continued to doubt miracles and scriptural revelation. They believed in reason rather than in saints.
          From Theism to Deism
          People started to believe that human society must also operate by natural laws. 
          The idea of progress – one of the dominant concepts of the age.
          There arose movements for social betterment, for humanitarianism: charities, prison reform; sympathy for the Indian, the slave, the poor, the oppressed.
          Society became eager for political change, they sought salvation through rebellion.
          Calvinist view – mankind of innately evil (original sin) – attacked
          John Locke’s view – tabula rasa (human beings were born neither good nor bad; all was the result of experience.
          Writers took their literary models and critical maxims from Greek and Roman literary works (classic – neoclassicism) The ancient ideals of clarity, decorum, and regularity became the measures of 18th century art. Literature was to avoid the ornate, the extravagant, the bombastic. Writing was to exhibit “clear sense” and “mathematical plainness”. 
          Prose should approach the rhythm of cultivated speech;
          Poetry should be written in the measured cadances of the heroic couplet;
          Drama should observe the unities of time, place, and action.
          In 1783, the year the United States achieved its independence, Noah Webster declared, “America must be as independent in literature as she is in politics, as famous for the arts as for arms.”
          The first American novel, William Hill Brown’s “The Power of Sympathy”. The first popular American novel, Susanna Rowson’s “Charlotte Temple”. Both were based vaguely on American events, but they followed closely the tradition established by the English novelist Samuel Richardson, whose Pamela set a standard for didactic sentimentalism that long dominated American fiction.
          The moral temper of the colonies discouraged development of drama. A Pennsylvania law of 1700 prohibited stage plays. Theater – indecent and corrupting, “dangerous to the soul of men”. The first American play (Thomas Godfrey’s The Prince of Parthia). 
          While imaginative literature in America remained derivative and dependent, the heroic revolutionary ambitions of the age were creating great political pamphleteering and state papers.

        <p> 8. THE PERIOD OF ROMANTICISM (1820s – 1860s)
          THE DRIVE WESTWARDS: Americans came to believe in the ‘Manifest Destiny’ (US should control the whole of North America). During the 1840s the pioneers started settling westward. This led to the  decimation of Indian tribes  - at the hands of both pioneers and American soldiers was an unfortunate consequence of this expansion westwards. Territorial expansion was accompanied by growing economic prosperity. An expanded postal system combined with the new telegraph to provide a quick and efficient means of communication. Information became more widely available to people as improvements were made to printing methods, and an ever increasing reading public gladly took to a steadily growing and more self-confident national literature. 
          
          SOCIAL CONCERNS: Social reform - a pressing issue; Education - a major concern;Women’s rights became an important issue; The most significant issue - SLAVERY.
          HOME AFFAIRS: Andrew Jackson (Democratic Party) was champion of the common man. Whereas all preceding Presidents of the United States had come from wealthy eastern families, Jackson had grown up as a poor child in a log cabin. His promises to eliminate privileged politics and establish a more equal distribution of political power became known as ‘Jacksonian democracy’.
          LITERARY CONTEXT
          A CONTRAST BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH - most writers of the period were working in New England. Few signs of a ‘Southern School’ developing; (English Romantic models were more closely adhered to in the South). 
          BASIC NOTIONS
          Romanticism is considered by many the real beginning of American literature; 
          Emphasis upon the imaginative and emotional qualities of literature;
          Nature – a refuge from the constraints of society;
          A liking for the picturesque, the exotic, the sensuous, and the supernatural; 
          A strong tendency to exalt the individual and the common man.
          NEW ENGLAND TRANSCENDENTALISM
          Romanticism on Puritan soil; 
          Flourished in New England (1830s – The Civil War);
          Transcendentalists took their ideas from European Romantic literature, German Idealistic philosophy, Oriental mysticism…
          A fresh perception of nature as symbolic of the spirit or God; 
          Feeling over reason; 
          Individual expression over the restraints of law and custom;
          The stress of the importance of the individual as the most important element of society; 
          Against the materialism of American society;
          They believed in the transcendence of the Oversoul (an all pervading power for goodness from which all things come and of which all things are part). 
          Ralph Waldo Emerson
          Key belief - each individual could transcend, or move beyond, the physical world of the senses into deeper spiritual experience through free will and intuition.
          God is not remote and unknowable; believers understood God and themselves by looking into their own souls and by feeling their own connection to nature. 
          Man is a part of absolute good.
          "The Over-Soul" - an essay. “Self-Reliance” (1841) - his most well-known essays (the reader is asked to examine his relationship with Nature and God and to trust his own judgment). 
          Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862)
          “Resistance to Civil Government“, often reprinted with the title "Civil Disobedience“(1849) - his most influential essay, in which he recommended disobeying unjust laws;

        <p>      10.ROMANTIC POETRY
          FOCUS: 19th CENTURY POETRY - THE NEW ENGLAND BRAHMINS; WALT WHITMAN; EMILY DICKINSON; EDGAR ALLAN POE.   
          1. The New England Brahmins: (Cambridge Poets, America’s Schoolroom, Household Poets or Fireside Poets) – a group of New England authors associated with Harvard, who were educated in Europe aristocrats, steeped into foreign culture. They were professors at Harvard and made Boston the literary capital.
          Characteristics:
          Use of traditional poetic subject and forms;
          Regular and familiar rhythms;
          High moral standards of behavior;
          Celebration of the family and the domestic life.
          
          REPRESENTATIVES:
          
          - a). James Russell Lowell : 
          „Conversations on Some of the Old Poets“ a collection of critical essays that included pleas for the abolition of slavery; 
          His Biglow Papers- a set of satirical verses in which Lowell uses a humor and original Yankee dialect. 
          
          b). Henry Wadsworth Longfellow : 
          
          Much of his verse tends to be derivative and conforms to the popular literary tastes of the day;
          The Tales of a Wayside Inn - modeled roughly on Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales.
          
          2. Walt Whitman: - A pioneer poet, he is cpart of the transition between transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views in his work. By birth a poet of the people; 
          One of the most highly individual and important authors in the history of American literature;
          The publication of Leaves of Grass in 1855 represented a revolutionary departure in American verse, both in terms of form and content. 
          A firm believer in Jacksonian democracy and the splendor of the common man;
          - “Leaves of Grass” (Whitman): Addressed to the citizens of the United States, Leaves of Grass was a autobiography in verse. Both prophetic and intimate, its glorification of democracy and the nation itself – its landscape and its people – was matched by an equally keen concern with the ideas, beliefs, experiences and emotions of the common man in an age which celebrated the value of individualism. This exaltation of the individual – in a physical as well as spiritual sense – commonly takes the form of the ‘I’ in his poems, and yet Whitman was keen to stress that each person is contained in all other people in a kind of mystical unity of personality. 
          - Whitman was a pioneer in terms of technical innovation. He experimented with free verse in an attempt to liberate American poetry from the restrictions and rules of traditional stanza and rhyme forms. His so-called long line contained a variable number of unstressed syllables and no strictly fixed meter, and he organized his stanzas into what he called ‘verse paragraphs’. 
          Some critics have argued that Whitman was primarily an egoist and sensualist, that his ego and vast sensual craving found their expression in his poetic celebration of the self, and that his constant desire to expand the boundaries of the self ultimately led him to identify himself with the cosmos. However, Whitman’s “I” is not only Whitman himself but his idea of the representative man. Whitman teaches that humanity is naturally good, and he identifies with all humanity. He considered each of his poems to be a separate leaf or ‘blade’ of grass because they were divine (though common), because they were symbolic of life and cycles of birth and death, and because they were significant both individually and in the mass.
          
          3. Emily Dickinson (1830 – 1886)  
          Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman – both highly individualistic, though Whitman’s individualism was public, while Dickinson’s was private. Both saw physical everyday things as symbols of spiritual things. Both rebelled against the poetic conventions of rhythm, meter and rhyme of their time. DIFFERENCES:  Dickinson’s ‘sense of limitation’ contrasts Whitman’s expansiveness; where Whitman was optimistic, Dickinson saw life as difficult, painful, and filled with losses – or with gains that were temporary and costly.
          Short and beautifully crafted poems;
          Experimental rhythm and rhyme;
          Enigmatic images and metaphor;
          Love, death and the natural universe are the main themes.
          Dickinson’s poetry reflects a Calvinistic sense of evil and the inevitability of spiritual struggle. Notable motifs in her poetry include:
          -	A sense of loss
          -	The idea of nature as both threat and a source of joy and comfort
          -	The ecstasy and the dangers of love
          -	The tension between faith and doubt
          -	A fascination with death
          
          Her nature images express both a delight in nature, suggestive of New England transcendentalism, and a Calvinistic sense of evil in nature. Some readers might find her poetry morbid and oppressive because of its emphasis on:
          
          -	Fear and anguish
          -	Renunciation and loss
          -	Sickness and starvation
          -	Pain and death
          
          4. Edgar Allan Poe: - A key representative of Dark Romanticism;
          Famous for his tales and poems of horror, mystery and suspense;
          Master of the Macabre and Father of the detective story (1st step: provide a seemingly impossible crime. 2nd step:  to have the detective character analyze the clues in order to solve the mystery. To explain to the audience just how intelligent the detective is, the narrator is not the detective but his less intelligent partner.  Poe’s Thou Art the Man became the first comic detective story and the first mystery in which the culprit turned out to be “the least likely suspect.”
           - Master of the Psychological Horror Story : Poe believed terror was a part of life and therefore a legitimate subject for literature. In Poe’s next horror tales he would move the action away from a remote castle and into an everyday setting like a home  or a school.  Even when Poe set his horror tale in a distant land he focused less on the location than on the psychology of his characters. 
          - America’s First Great Literary Critic :     the first to accuse an author of plagiarism if their work too closely resembled that of another author.      When judging the quality: should be original and should have an emotional impact on the reader.  Poe thought that the entire story should be composed with that emotional impact in mind.  If one were to take breaks in the middle of reading, the emotional impact the story is intended to evoke would be diluted by all the distractions of the real world.

          DARK ROMANTICISM

          An emphasis on human fallibility that gives rise to lapses in judgement that allow even good men and women to drift toward sin and self-destruction, and also tends to draw attention to the unintended consequences and complications that arise from well-intended efforts at social reform.

        <p> 12. THE CIVIL WAR (1861-1865)
          All northern states had abolished slavery by the early 1800s, but the plantation system of farming in the South depended on a cheap labor force for its economic survival, and black slaves were therefore indispensable. Denouncing the ‘peculiar institution’ of slavery as a moral sin, the abolitionist movement gained strength particularly in the New England states, and southerners became more and more convinced that federal government would eventually outlaw it. During the 1830s some southern leaders justified the existence of slavery by arguing that whites were superior to blacks and that their status as slaves was perfectly suited to their natural condition, 
          - Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin in 1851 served to inflame public opinion still further: The novel was highly influential in stirring up popular feeling against slavery, and was cited by Lincoln as one of the main causes of the Civil War. The impact of the book lies in its illustration of slavery’s effects on families, and to help readers empathize with enslaved characters. Uncle Tom’s Cabin contributed to the outbreak of war by personalizing the political and economic arguments about slavery. Conversational writing style, which inspired people.                
          - Confederate states seceded from the Union because of Abraham Lincoln's (Republican) staunch anti-slavery views. Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy and insisted they had no right to leave the Union,. By April 1861 Confederate forces were at war with those of the Union: the American Civil War had begun. Better organized and financed, the soldiers of the Union gradually wore down the spirited forces of the Confederacy. The Civil war cost the country dear: 
          Congress passed to further the rights of blacks in America: 
          - the 13th amendment - abolished slavery in the United States, 
          - 14th: confirmed the citizenship of blacks 
          - 15th - made it illegal to deny the right to vote on the basis of race. 
          RECONSTRUCTION and BIG BUSINESSES. AMERICAN SOCIETY: Economic growth was in part facilitated by a growing domestic market. 
           Immigrants arriving in the ‘Promised Land’ provided both cheap labor and a ready market of consumers.
          During what Mark Twain called ‘The Gilded Age’, many individuals amassed huge fortunes and attempted to imitate the culture and manners of their upper class European counterparts. They built glamorous mansions, bought and imported European works of art, attended the opera and went to refined clubs and restaurants. The working or laboring class, however, lived for the most part in great poverty in crowded slums and tenement buildings with little or no sanitation. Disease was common, working hours were long and education among the poor was virtually non-existent. 
          THE ‘PROGRESSIVE ERA’ :  reformers or ‘progressives’ as they had become known, succeeded in bringing about many changes. During the 1880s farmers’ unions successfully pressed the railroad companies to lower transport costs. Better wages and working conditions, women got the right to vote in Wyoming in 1869. 
          LITERARY CONTEXT
          Americans became more inquisitive about people living in other parts of the country. After the Civil War, their curiosity was in part satisfied by a number of authors known collectively as ‘literary comedians’ and ‘local colorists’. 
          LOCAL COLORISM – THE BEGINNING OF REALISM
          Wrote mainly for newspapers and magazines;
          Concentrated on colorful descriptions of local traditions, customs, manners, dress and – most importantly – dialects and speech;
          Their humor - mostly bound up with slang, bad spelling and incorrect grammar;
          Some of these authors wrote amusing ‘tall tales’ about exaggerated heroes and incidents;
          More serious stories and novels covering almost every corner of the country were written by the ‘local colorists’: in their sympathetic portrayal of mostly simple folk in provincial communities and their attention to dialect and local customs.
           These works in part paved the way for the movements of realism and naturalism which were to dominate the American novel over the coming decades.
          Francis Bret Harte (1836 – 1902) – best remembered for his short fiction featuring miners, gamblers, and other romantic figures of the California Gold Rush.

          FOCUS: BASIC 19TH CENTURY LITERARY TRENDS: REALISM AND NATURALISM
REALISM
Realism as a literary doctrine originated in France. It called for “reality and truth” in the depiction of ordinary life.
A reaction against Romanticism or a move away from romance and self-creating fictions;
A great interest in the realities of life, everyday existence, what was brutal or sordid and class struggle;
The background and training of the new authors was middle-class and journalistic rather than genteel and academic;
Influenced by Zola, Flaubert, Balzac, Dostoyevsky, and Tolstoy;
Insisted that the ordinary and the local were just as suitable for artistic portrayal as the magnificent and the remote.
REPRESENTATIVES:
William Dean Howells (1837-1920)
He defined the aims of realism as ‘nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material’. 
He was the champion of realism, and his novels carefully interweave social circumstances with the emotions of ordinary middleclass Americans.
In The Rise of Silas Lapham (1885), Howells best illustrated his aims, and his call up on writers to deal with the ordinary, average lives of American people.
Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), or Mark Twain
His stories and novels are famous for their humor, vivid details, and memorable characters. 
His best-known works are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
He examined American culture on the edge of the frontier and dealt seriously with such issues as slavery, poverty, and class differences.
In his sketches, articles, stories, and novels, he captured the flavor and spirit of America during the late nineteenth century.
Universal themes that affect people of all times. 
Samuel Clemens, better known by his pen name of Mark Twain, grew up in the Mississippi River frontier town of Hannibal, Missouri. 
 Early 19th-century American writers tended to be too flowery, sentimental, or ostentatious — partially because they were still trying to prove that they could write as elegantly as the English. Twain’s style, based on vigorous, realistic, colloquial American speech, gave American writers a new appreciation of their national voice. Twain was the first major author to come from the interior of the country, and he captured its distinctive, humorous slang and iconoclasm. For Twain and other American writers of the late 19th century, realism was not merely a literary technique: It was a way of speaking truth and exploding worn-out conventions. 
The most well-known example is Huck Finn, a poor boy who decides to follow the voice of his conscience and help a Negro slave escape to freedom, even though Huck thinks this means that he will be damned to hell for breaking the law. 
Huck and Jim float on a raft down the majestic Mississippi, but are sunk by a steamboat, separated, and later reunited. They go through many comical and dangerous shore adventures that show the variety, generosity, and sometimes cruel irrationality of society. In the end, itis discovered that Miss Watson hadalready freed Jim, and a respectable family is taking care of the wild boy Huck. But Huck grows impatient with civilized society and plans to escape to “the territories” — Indian lands. The ending gives the reader the counter-version of the classic American success myth: the open road leading to the pristine wilderness, away from the morally corrupting influences of “civilization.”
NATURALISM
Shortly before and after the turn of the twentieth century;
Influenced by Darwin’s theory and the 19th century French literature (Emile Zola);
Subjects from the lower ranks of the society
Portrayed misery and poverty of the underdogs who were victims of society and nature;
A major theme – human bestiality, especially as an explanation of sexual desire.

REPRESENTATIVES:
Stephen Crane (Red Badge of Courage, Maggie, A Girl of the Street…)
Frank Norris (McTeague…)
Theodore Dreiser (Sister Carrie, An American Tragedy…)
Jack London (The Call of the Wild; Martin Eden…)

REALISM VS NATURALISM
While being two separate literary movements, realism and naturalism have been at times used as interchangeable terms, sharing some deep-running similarities:
1) They are both "basic" views of life and humanity, stripping away the layers of romanticism to present a "natural" or "real" outlook of the work. They refuse to idealize or flatter the subject. They avoid artificial, fantasy, or supernatural elements.
2) Both of these pessimistic views emerged in the 19th century, a period known for its trials and turmoil.
3) God is absent from most of the writing in either category, with writers opting for a focus on the real world.
But despite these similarities, these two literary movements are separate for a reason.
1) Realism sought to be a faithful representation of life, while naturalism was more like a "chronicle of despair." In a way, naturalism proceeded from realism, and can be seen as an exaggerated form of realism; it shows humans as being determined by environment, heredity, and social conditions beyond their control, and thus rather helpless to escape their circumstances.
2) While in realism the main focus was on the middle class and its problems, naturalism often focused on poorly educated or lower-class characters, and on themes involving violence and taboo activities.
3) While in realism, faithful representation of reality including the details of nature is important, in Naturalism, nature itself is a force, generally a powerful, indifferent mechanism.
One might say that Naturalism is more limited kind of realism in which individual characters are not so much opened up and explored psychologically by the careful observation of their manners and moods and by the credible development of their circumstances, as they are buffeted and usually ruined by the greater forces of the world around them. Naturalism, almost despite its name, is saturated with the symbolic, whereas Realism is only lightly tinged with it.
Naturalists employ pop versions of evolutionary theory: humans retain animal qualities; God is absent, the natural forces (usually negative) prevail; chance and violence are omnipresent as causes. Cities and machines provide negative mass pressures.

        THE TURN OF THE CENTURY
FOCUS: BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY
WORLD WAR I 
broke out between the Allies  and the Central powers, Woodrow Wilson attempted to maintain American neutrality. American forces joined towards the end of the war which was crucial. After the war the US condemned itself to a period of isolationism in the field of international affairs for the next twenty years – until the outbreak of the Second World War once again led to cries for assistance.
POST-WAR AMERICAN SOCIETY
witnessed continued growth in terms of population, and a continued movement away from rural areas to the ever increasing number of sprawling urban cities. This trend also brought about changes in the everyday lives of American people: city life was inevitably more hectic and impersonal, and family ties inevitably became weaker.
THE ROARING TWENTIES
brought with them radical changes in lifestyle. The 19th amendment to the Constitution (1920) had given women the right to vote, and, armed with their newly acquired independence, they quickly took advantage of the new opportunities opening up around them in the field of work. Some women (known as ‘Flappers’) rejected the more sober clothes of their predecessors in favor of shorter skirts and daring hairstyles. 
Flappers- young women in the 1920s who wore short skirts, listened to jazz music and showed their disdain for what was considered accepted behavior. They defined the modern look for the women (excessive make-up, drinking alcohol, smoking, driving cars…). Viewed by many at the time as outrageous, immoral or downright dangerous, they are now considered the first generation of independent American women.
The eighteenth ‘Prohibition’ amendment (1920) had attempted to outlaw sales of liquor, but ‘speak-easies’ (or secret nightclubs) ensured that ‘bootleg’ (illegally procured) alcohol was available in generous quantities to an ever thirsty public. 
Gangs of thugs seeking control of the illegal alcohol market proliferated in the larger cities and the levels of crime and violence rose considerably.
A series of Republican administrations under Harding, Coolidge and Hoover attempted to curb the newly unleashed forces of hedonism and restore older and more traditional social values. The efforts of federal government to curb contemporary excesses found sympathetic support in other sections of society. Religious revivalism became increasingly popular in both rural and urban areas, and after a period of relative anonymity the Ku Klux Klan returned to its former strengths. It took blacks, Jews, Catholics and political radicals as its scapegoats for society’s ills.
THE WALL STREET CRASH
Not everyone benefited from the economic prosperity of the 1920s: while manufacturers and large companies continued to expand. Little was done to help either American farmers or laborers, resulting in poverty and reduction in domestic demand. Then the stockmarket crash happened-speculation pushed the value investments to artificially high levels. The Great Depression which followed lasted for 10 years.
THE NEW DEAL
In 1932 the Democrat Roosevelt became president. His program for recovery (the New Deal) provided the much needed econmic stimulus and social reform and assistance.  By the end of the decade these measures were beginning to have positive effects, and such was Roosevelt’s popularity who got re-elected four times. A much needed boost to the economy in the form of military spending was provided by the Second World War – the next serious challenge to America’s development as a world power.

          15. MODERNISM
FOCUS: LITTLE MAGAZINES. MODERNISM IN POETRY. IMAGISM. EZRA POUND; T. S. ELIOT; ROBERT FROST; WALLACE STEVENS; E. E. CUMMINGS.
The inter-war period in American literary history was characterized by experimentation and creative inventiveness as writers – especially in the field of poetry – attempted to come to terms with new philosophical and psychological interpretations of reality. The discovery of the subconscious and new concepts regarding time meant that the scope of literary reference was broadened and orthodox beliefs of the past were laid open to question.
Aesthetic consideration were formalized anew as American literary criticism matured: Ezra Pound, leading literary critic of the time, was joined by T.S. Eliot and Wallace Stevens in his analysis of the writer’s craft, and further important contributions were made by Earnest Hemingway and the influential Gertrude Stein. 
LITTLE MAGAZINES
Writers measured themselves according to new literary canons as ‘literary criticism’ developed into a serious and systematic genre. Conventional standards and established authors were questioned and attacked by a new body of writers whose works were frequently published by the so called ‘little magazines’ – independent-minded periodicals more concerned with publishing new authors and establishing new critical standards than the material rewards of commercial success. 
MODERNISM
Experimentation and creative inventiveness;
New ideas;
Breaking with tradition;
Fragmentation;
Experimentation with point of view;
American literary criticism matured.
AMERICAN MODERNIST POETS
Ezra Pound (1885–1972)
A controversial figure;
Technical innovations and use of unconventional poetic materials which often baffled readers;
No determinant identity or poetic voice;
A multiplicity of identities and voices;
A fierce individualist.
IMAGISM
An anti-Romantic movement in poetry; 
Simple and few words;
The image is let to speak of itself;
Derived its technique from classical Chinese and Japanese poetry—stressing clarity, precision, and economy of language; 
Everyday speech, new rhythms, and clear, sharp images;
Key representatives of Imagism: Ezra Pound, Hilda Doolittle (H. D.) and Amy Lowell.
Pound's rules for writing Imagist poems:
1. Direct treatment of the "thing," whether subjective or objective.
2. To use absolutely no word that did not contribute to the presentation.
3. As regarding rhythm: to compose in sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome.
In a Station of the Metro
The apparition of these faces in the crowd;
Petals on a wet, black bough.
                                                        (Ezra Pound)
SOME HELPFUL HINTS TO ANALYZE THE POEM:
1. Think about the function of the title of the poem.
2. Pay attention to the images and the way they are introduced in the poem in terms of syntax.
3. Is he comparing? Is he seeing both things?
4. Does this approach remind you of any poetic tradition?

T. S. Eliot (1888-1965)
- Came under the influence of Ezra Pound;
 - The Waste Land (1922) - considered to be the most influential poetic work of the 20th century; 
- His poems articulated the disillusionment of a younger post–World War I generation with the values and conventions of the Victorian era.
Robert Frost (1874-1963)

At the crossroads of 19th-century American poetry and modernism;
His poetry is resolutely American;
An original, modern idiom and a sense of directness and economy that reflect the imagism of Ezra Pound  and Amy Lowell;
On the other hand - no marked departure from the poetic practices of the 19th century;
Avoids traditional verse forms, but his technique is never experimental and he is not an innovator.
The Rose Family
(Robert Frost)
The rose is a rose,
And was always a rose.
But the theory now goes
That the apple's a rose,
And the pear is, and so's
The plum, I suppose.
The dear only knows
What will next prove a rose.
You, of course, are a rose -
But were always a rose.
SOME HELPFUL HINTS TO ANALYZE THE POEM:
1. Think about the symbolism behind the rose.
2. What might be the aim of this cliché?
3. What feeling does the constant repetition evoke in you?
Wallace Stevens (1879-1955)
Focused his attention on man and the things in his world; 
A master stylist, employing an extraordinary vocabulary and a rigorous precision in crafting his poems. 
A philosopher of aesthetics, vigorously exploring the notion of poetry as the supreme fusion of the creative imagination and objective reality. 
E. E. Cummings (1894–1962)
- One of the most innovative poets of his time; 
- Experimented with poetic form and language to create a distinct personal style; 
- Disregarded grammar and punctuation; 
- Always used “i” instead of “I” as a protest against self-importance;

          THE LOST GENERATION
FOCUS: Ernest Hemingway; Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald
World War I was followed by a period of spiritual crisis characterized by:
the feeling of gloom and despair; 
modern warfare was not glorious or heroic; 
a sense of doom, dislocation and fragmentation; 
a sense of loss: a loss of faith and of inherited, pre-war values, which no longer seemed relevant;
pre-war ideals of patriotism, faith and morality were questioned;
writers felt the old norms were no longer relevant.
LOST GENERATION - in general, the post-World War I generation, but specifically a group of U.S. writers who established their literary reputations in the 1920s: Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, E. E. Cummings, Archibald MacLeish, Hart Crane, T. S. Eliot and many other writers who made Paris the center of their literary activities in the 1920s. They were never a literary school and in the 1930s they turned in different directions. 
Spiritual alienation from a U.S. that seemed to be hopelessly provincial, materialistic, and emotionally barren.
The term was coined by Gertrude Stein 
Gertrude Stein      
CHARACTERISTICS:
Expatriates who lived in Paris;
Sought the meaning of life;

Avoids the adjective whenever possible;
A master of dialogue.

Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald  (1896 – 1940)
SOME BIOGRAPHICAL FACTS
WORKS
This Side of Paradise (1920)

          1940-PRESENT
HISTORICAL CONTEXT
PARTICIPATION IN WW2
Following the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, America joined the Allies. In 1945, President Truman gave orders to drop the atomic bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and thus brought to an abrupt end the Second World War.
THE COLD WAR
Despite being allies throughout the war, Russia and the Americans were to embark on a new kind of war after 1945: the so-called Cold War lasted up until very recent times and was characterized by American attempts to contain the advancing threat of communism throughout the world. America provided countries threatened with communism with both financial and military aid up until the official collapse of the Eastern Bloc in the late 80s. Both the wars in Korea (1950-53) and Vietnam (1957-75) saw American troops deployed in an effort to crush the communist threat in these two countries. The Americans took many years to recover from the effects of this war. 
Ronald Reagan’s presidency (1980-88) was influential in reducing nuclear arms on both sides and the collapse of the Berlin Wall on 1989 further accelerated the end of the Cold War. 
HOME AFFAIRS. THE AMERICAN SOCIETY.
Increasing material wealth but continued division between rich and poor; 
Despite inflation and recession the American economy prospered after WW2;
An ever-growing number of consumers provided a ready market for the wealth of goods available
A general move from the cities to the suburbs during the post war period and the automobile became an indispensable aspect of modern American life;
Not everybody shared in the growing prosperity: large minority groups of blacks and Hispanic Americans lived in the poverty stricken areas of urban America;
In the 1950s - a chorus of organized protests; This was to culminate in the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s: Martin Luther King (assassinated in 1968) and Malcolm X became the active voices of Black American protest, and, although measures were taken to improve the lot of blacks in America during the 1960s, minority groups continued to be discriminated against through the 1970s and 1980s. 

The gap between rich and poor became increasingly evident during the Reagan administration.
LITERARY CONTEXT
After the Second World War American literature continued to flourish but not in any one distinct direction: it would be difficult to say what its mainstream works are. Instead, other sections of the variegated patchwork that is American society began to produce important writings including Jews, African-Americans, Native-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans, homosexuals and so on. Perhaps the only theme that links together these various groups is their interest in America’s theme par excellence: individuality.
THE BEAT GENERATION
Included prose writers and poets centered in San Francisco and NYC in the 1940s and 1950s;
BEAT = ‘beaten down’ or ‘beatific’;
Celebrated freedom and stood against middle-class values, commercialism and conformity;
Enthusiasm for the visionary states produced by religious meditation, sexual experience, jazz, or drugs;
Drew their inspiration from quintessential American artists (Walt Whitman) and the jazz composer and musician Charlie Parker, as well as from Zen Buddhism.
MAIN REPRESENTATIVES: Jack Kerouac- On the Road;
Allen Ginsberg – Howl (the manifesto of the Beat Movement) - poets who also took Walt Whitman as their spiritual and literary father.
Holy Peter holy Allen holy Solomon holy Lucien holy Kerouac holy Huncke holy Burroughs holy Cassady holy the unknown buggered and suffering beggars holy the hideous human angels! […]
(Footnote to Howl by Allen Ginsberg)

It is obvious that the extract above sounds quite different in tone. Poetic inspiration is no longer found in an archive. Poetry is that holy, lived experience, the ecstatic. A new use of language – mirroring the speed of experience. You might have felt embarrassed while reading it! Embarrassment is something that the beats wanted and valued.
Jack Kerouac (1922 – 1969)
A novelist recognized for his method of spontaneous prose;
On the Road (1957) – a semiautobiographical novel, which documents pretty closely the actual road trips that Kerouac took with his friends;
Language – aiming to reproduce experience;
A new kind of language – elimination of small words (the, and …); syntax can be set aside; language needs to move at the speed of experience and at the speed of ecstasy. Language – imitating experience.
PROSE
Flourishing American literature but not a distinct direction of it; 
Different sections of the American society started to produce important writings;
Jewish novelists – continued to some degree the Yiddish tradition and blended it into American writing (Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, Philip Roth);
African-American writers – Tony Morrison wrote about the black experience in America from the times of slavery to this day; her writing is highly poetic but never ignores the horrors and tragedies of life;

AMERICAN POST WW2 FICTION

- Norman Mailer - The Naked and the Dead (1948)
- James Jones - From Here to Eternity (1951

SATIRE AND DARK HUMOR
J. D. Salinger (1919- 2010) - The Catcher in the Rye (1951) – a classical portrayal of rebellious youth;
Joseph Heller (1923 – 1999) –Catch-22 (1961) – a humorous madness about the madness of war.
COMPLEX PLOTS
Thomas Pynchon (1937 -) – V (1963)
Kurt Vonnegut (1922 – 2007) - Slaughterhouse-Five 
Both authors shared the same belief that human beings are trapped in a meaningless world and neither God nor man can make sense of the human condition.
Vladimir Nabokov (1899 – 1977)
A Russian-born American novelist and critic;
Wrote both in Russian and English;
Refined prose and complex literary structures;
Being an outsider made him particularly aware of the manias of modern America;
Lolita (1955) – the satirical tale of a college professor who falls in love with a young girl.
POETRY
CONFESSIONAL POETS
Robert Lowell, Randall Jarrell, John Berryman, Theodore Roethke, … - impersonal, hard-edged poetry for intense personal confessions, often presented in finely crafted poems in traditional forms;

Sylvia Plath used this confessional style to give a poetic portrayal of her psychological breakdown.
OTHER GROUPS
BLACK POETS – inspired by the Beats; (Gwendolyn Brooks, Amiri Baraka);
NATIVE AMERICANS – towards the end of the last century large numbers of Native American poets begin to write in English;
CHICANO (MEXICAN-AMERICAN) poetry: Rudolfo Anaya, Cherrie Moraga and Gary Soto. They write in both Spanish and English, often blending poetry and prose.
DRAMA
Eugene O’Neill (1888 – 1953)
Introduced psychological and social realism to the American stage; (techniques earlier associated with Russian playwright Anton Chekhov and Henrik Ibsen);
The first to include speeches in American vernacular and involve characters on the fringes of society;
Experimental and emotionally probing dramas; deep psychological complexity.
