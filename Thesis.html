         <p>Examples of interview&#160;questions:</p>

<p>I. About myself:</p>

<p>My name is Alex Tarchini, I am a qualified EN teacher and I have experience of teaching EN to various groups: starting from the youngest, to high school students, to university students and elderly. I have hold a MA in EN philology and teaching EN has always been what I really want to do.</p>

<p> I also have MA in BUS and POS, and I worked as a contract agent for 7 years in the EU Commission.</p>

<p>I am married and I have a cute little 2-year old son. I am Bulgarian, and I am very motivated, determined, and outgoing. Do you have any more questions about me...</p>

<p>II. Teaching Experience</p>

<p>1. What is your EN teaching experience:</p>

<p>- 1. Ethos (2008-2209): I have a MA degree in EN philology and have a professional qualification for an EN teacher.</p>

<p>- My experience: I first started teaching EN to children from disadvantaged groups as part of the social outreach programme of Ethos Open Hands Foundation. I was a volunteeer EN teacher to a group of about 10 kids. The course was 5 months, once per week at weekends. We initially started with high absenteesm, but bu the end of the course the kids finished all successfully.</p>

<p>- considering the diverse backgrounds and levels of the kids I designed my own programme as to adjust the programme to the needs of the kids and make the course more rleevant for them. E.g. Presentations about travel, cooking, study opportunites abroad. - For the grammar I was following an existing programme from textbook.</p>

<p>2. Teaching practice Sayanova (spring 2021): I was teaching EN to 3 groups of secondary and high school students. I was following a structured programme, but I did my best to adapt to the needs of the groups and to make it more relevant. 3 groups (8th, 9, 10th grades). 2 classes per day, every day for 2 months.</p>

<p>3. Private lessons at home to students of different ages: Mario (elderly), 2 other younger kids (6-8 years old). Taylored, TOEFL and SAT1 unviersity students.</p>

<p>4. Teaching practice (SWU, university): I would give also lessons in the regional capital as part of my teaching practice. Enjoyable experience to teach young people.</p>

<p>III. What makes you special: My background: I am a Roma qho grew up in the so called ghetto. Ever sicne I was little, my dream was to be a teacher and change the world around me.</p>

<p>IV. MA Thesis:</p>

<p>- context and result: my research looked at the motivation for intl expats in Brussels to learn EN: The results revealed that they are more externally motivated (i.e. They study EN to grow on the job and get more opportunities).</p>

<p>- I collected data from expats: (online questionanire and did statistical analysis, lit review, comparison of my results with the literature).</p>

<p>1. Describe a time when you and your professor/advisor/supervisor/co-worker had a difference of opinion and how you handled the situation.</p>

<p>&#160;Context: In my previous job in the EU Commission, we would have a high turnover of managers. We got a new HoU who seemed to assign many tasks to me that were piling up, theough they were not in my port folio and he thought that I was not doing enough.</p>

<p>Action: I decided to have am honest and transparent conversation with my HoU and scheduled a meeting with him to brief him on my work and portfolio.</p>

<p>Result: As a result, he got a better overview of the work of my team, and he consequently started getting more involved and supportive of our work. Which actually helped us a lot in producing better results.</p>

<p>&#160;2. Describe the organizational system that you use to juggle multiple work responsibilities at one time.</p>

<p>- I would spread the tasks in my agenda in different bits every day to have overview and make sure I deliver good results within the deadlines. Depending on the availability of my team. + Strategy: morning for more demanding tasks when I have more energy.</p>

<p>C:</p>

<p>A:</p>

<p>R:</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;3. Describe a time when you were involved in a project or research that was not going well and tell me how you handled it and the outcome.</p>

<p>C: We had a big pilot project commissioned my the EU Parliament. My team had to collaborate with another team at a higher level, but there was lots of competition and distruct within the teams and basically there was no communication.</p>

<p>A: I was in good relations with both teams, so I volunteered to bridge my team with the other team and facilitate the communication.</p>

<p>R: In the end the project turned from a backlock into a successful pilot project, and we achieved the aim of the project: the learnings from the project got published into reccommendations from the Parliament to the Mss, and were mainstreamed into Roma inclusion policy. So, learnings turned into policy. One learning: Early school education is essential for giving good start to children from disadvantaged background.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;4. Describe a time when you were put in a questionable ethical position and how you handled it:</p>

<p>I took on a research project and my university sent me to India to do a research with the Indian Dalits. I had problems getting a research visa because the Indian authorities were suspicious of me. Later on was advised to get a tourist visa, but I eventually decided to stay true to the purpose of my trip and be politically correct. I got the visa, but they warned me to be very careful.</p>

<p>A: . In my research I tried to be objective, state facts and at the same time be honest about the situation of the Dalits. A: I interviewed both Dalits and government to stay max objective.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;5. Tell me about a time when someone was critical of your work and how you responded.:</p>

<p>Context: Mikel Landabaso saying R portfolio is a lost cause, would give quite insensitve comment considering that our team was dealing with social inclusion.</p>

<p>I got constructive feedback, even though people were quite insensitive. However, I learnt to take it professionally, not personally and focus on the areas that I can improve (or be more strategic in the efforts I would allocate for the different portfolios).</p>

<p>I learnt from this feedback and improved: I diversified my portfolio not dealing on with Roma, but also doing social enterpreneurship, education. Etc.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>6. Give me an example of a time when you failed to meet a deadline and tell me why: In the EU Commission we were not allowed to miss deadlines.</p>

<p>- In my personal life:</p>

<p>C: During my pregnancy I was in my last stage of my teaching degree qualification. My health state was not allowing me to be on top of the emails from the university. So I realised that I had missed the deadline for submitting MA thesis proposal</p>

<p>A: I contacted the prof. Responsible for the class, explaining why and apologising for the delay. I managed to negotiate a new date for the proposal and I submitted it.</p>

<p>R: I successfully sibmitted my proposal by the new deadline, but I had to work much faster.</p>

<p>7. Describe a time when you were working with a team and tell me about your role in the group:</p>

<p>Context: I started working in the EU instituations as a team assistant</p>

<p>Action: I was very proactive and motivated (trying to learning as much as possible on the rjob).</p>

<p>Result: I was in good relations with the whole team and even when they had communication problems, they would use me often as a bridge b/n them.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;10. Tell me about a time when you were working in a team environment and one of your team colleagues was not producing as expected. How did you handle the situation?</p>

<p>Context: (Andor) I knew this colleague had a difficulty of meeting deadlines</p>

<p>Action: So, every evening before leaving I would remind him of the deadlines for the day</p>

<p>Result: This resulted in much less missed deadlines in the strategic reporting for our team, since I joined.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>11. Describe a particular problem that you encountered at work and how you went about solving:</p>

<p>C: I was teaching EN to kids from disadvantaged background. Very often they would be late or skip classes, which was very disruptive for the programme</p>

<p>A: To motivate the students to come on time I was making the lectures more interesting and attractive to them. In particular, I was asking more personal questions in EN (e.g. What they want to do in their life, and I would assign presentations on topics of their interest, so they were more involved). I was using visuals to attract their attention.</p>

<p>R: The attendance rate got better, and even more kids joined.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>12. What motivates you?:</p>

<p>- Apart from Financial security and recognition, Helping society through my work, as a teacher to teach the new generations.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>13. What would you change if you could start your career over?: change my course of study</p>

<p>- I started my studies in Business, then I did programming, but I discovered my passion has always been teaching.</p>

<p>I would have started my education directly in teaching if I could go back.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>14. Give me a specific example that shows you are a good team player: bridging the communication b/n the 2 teams</p>

<p>15. How do you manage conflicts in teams? Give me an example:</p>

<p>- confront the persons, speak with them and share my opinion, but also actively listen to hear their side of the story.</p>

<p>15. Tell me about a time you influenced a group:</p>

<p>- C: we did a charity run to support kids from disadvantaged background.</p>

<p>- A: I was part of a youth group and I shared my experience and showed them pics of where I used to live and showed them how much the kids back home need these school materials. I also shared my personal experience because I myself was helped by other people during my school years and this enabled me finish my studied successfully.</p>

<p>- R: All the youth group participated together with me at the 20K, we managed to collect enough means to buy school materials for 120 kids back home.</p>

<p>16. What positive and negative things would your teammates and</p>

<p>colleagues have to say about you?:</p>

<p>- a good team player, I am good reducing tensions and I have a welcoming and positive attitude.</p>

<p>- In the past I might have tend to jump to conlusions based on my experience and intuition, without looking too much at the data. Since then I have improved and I am more intentionally looking into the data and information before coming to a conlusion.</p>

<p>17. What was the best constructive criticism you received? How did</p>

<p>you respond? Give a concrete example:</p>

<p>- During my 1st lesson of teaching practice, my prof. Gave me a very important constructive feedback that I have to more intentionally involve the students into the lesson and not being the only one lecturing and speaking all the time.</p>

<p>Since then, in my lessons I ask the students questions to make sure that they actively participate, and to trigger their mind and thinking process (and also practice) .</p>

<p>18. What type of roles have you played in teams?: I grew from team assistant to Assistant Policy Officer.</p>

<p>19. How do you motivate your subordinates? Give me an example: Run for the Glory &ndash; I showed them the vision and goal of the project, and how their work and commitment would impract the life of many kids in need. (I explain clearly the goals, and I do not retain the positive feedback, while giving constructive feedback as necessary).</p>

<p>20. How do you deal with a difficult superior? Give me an example:</p>

<p>Context: In my previous job in the EU Commission, we would have a high turnover of managers. We got a new HoU who seemed to assign many tasks to me that were piling up, theough they were not in my port folio and he thought that I was not doing enough.</p>

<p>Action: I decided to have am honest and transparent conversation with my HoU and scheduled a meeting with him to brief him on my work and portfolio.</p>

<p>Result: As a result, he got a better overview of the work of my team, and he consequently started getting more involved and supportive of our work. Which actually helped us a lot in producing better results.</p>

<p>21. What was your greatest team accomplishment? What role did you</p>

<p>have on the outcome?:</p>

<p>- C: Run4TheGlory: we did a charity run to support kids from disadvantaged background.</p>

<p>- A: I was part of a youth group and I shared my experience and showed them pics of where I used to live and showed them how much the kids back home need these school materials. I also shared my personal experience because I myself was helped by other people during my school years and this enabled me finish my studied successfully.</p>

<p>- R: All the youth group participated together with me at the 20K, we managed to collect enough means to buy school materials for 120 kids back home.</p>

<p>22. Tell me about a time when you had to convince someone not agreeing with you (impact dimension):</p>

<p>- My husband and I come from 2 very different background and cultures. Sometimes we would have disagreements.</p>

<p>- Context: Visiting flats to buy. R really liked one of the 1st flatw we visited &ndash; did not require renovation, but it was much mor expensive and very far from the city centre.</p>

<p>- Action: I talked it over with my husband and explained that we should not rush and to look for better deals. I showed him some examples of renovations that were done easily and within a good budget.</p>

<p>- Result: I managed to successfully convince him not to rush and we eventually found a flat that was in a much better location, require some doable renovation and much much cheaper. As a result we got our current flat and we had to get only a small loan, instead of taking a huge mortgage for many years.</p>

<p>23. What has been your major achievement so far (drive dimension) :</p>

<p>- My major achievement is building a happy family with my husband and son, and being a responsible citizen - trying to do something good for the people around us each day.</p>

<p>24. Why should we hire you:</p>

<p>After eploring what I want to do, I am sure that teaching EN is what I want to do in my life.</p>

<p>With the different experiences in my life, I have learned that I am a good motivator and I would love to motivate kids and adults to learn EN. Plus, I really like the language.</p>

<p>- I am also a responsible person and trustworthy.</p>

<p>How would&#160;you&#160;friends, family and colleagues describe you? : Positive minded, kind, motivated, caring, empathetic, inclusive. My personality type is a harmoniser. I enjoy teaching &ndash; even in my private life.</p>

<p>Why did you choose to become a EN teacher &lt;xyz&gt;? (xyz&gt; can be anything related to employment, university or extracurricular activities):</p>

<p>Since I was a child I was playing to be a teacher, I was imitating my teachers.</p>

<p>My favourite and most encoruaging teacher at school was my EN teacher: I really wanted to become like her.</p>

<p>However when I grew up I did not choose this path, but I eventually realised that my calling is to become a teacher, which has a much more positive impact on society.</p>

<p>In teaching I see immediate results, while in policy &ndash; it could take decades.</p>
