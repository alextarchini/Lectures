    speech.text = "The objective of this thesis is to understand the motivational factors driving expatriates in Brussels to learn English as a second language. Brussels is a very cosmopolitan city where 179 different nationalities live and use English as lingua franca to communicate among each other. There is not much research in literature on second language learning motivation on expatriates, and the publications available in literature focus on the motivation to learn the language of the host country rather than global English. This study employs Taguchi’s (2009) questionnaire as quantitative method to understand what motivational factors are most related to the intended effort to study English (which is a measure of motivation) in the context of Dornyei’s L2 self motivation theory. The sample used in the study consists of 40 expatriates learning English in Brussels. The main outcome of the study is that the ‘Attitudes towards learning English’ and ‘Incentive values’ (a variable including instrumental motives and travel orientation) are the factors most closely related to the intended effort, whereas the Ideal L2 self and Ought-to L2 self did not directly correlate with the intended effort. I. Introduction 1.1 Origins of the study Growing up as a Roma girl in the segregated Roma district of the town of Razlog in the south western region of Bulgaria, I was not encouraged by my teachers to invest effort in my education, and in fact often discouraged, as teachers did not really like to have Roma pupils in their classrooms. Later, in my life, when I started my secondary school education, I began to learn English. I really fell in love with the language and that was primarily because of my English teacher’s attitude. She never discriminated me for being a Roma and always showed a very different attitude compared with the other teachers, always inspiring and encouraging, which really motivated me to put effort in learning the language. Some of my motivation to study English was also related to the prospect of finding new and exciting study and work opportunities abroad. Since then, the topic of motivation to study, and specifically motivation to learn English, has always been very close to my heart. I started to be more and more intrigued about what the current theories say about the main drivers of language learning motivation and psychological structures related to it, not only to try to see if my main personal motives to learn English were reflected in the theories, but also to understand and learn how one day I could become an inspiring and motivating teacher to my future students. Therefore, I have chosen to carry out this research work on English language learning motivation and I chose expatriates living and studying English in Brussels as a target group. There is not much literature addressing this group profile and I therefore hope I can contribute with my study to bringing something new to the research on English language learning motivation. 1.2 Organisation of the thesis In the next chapter of the thesis, the objective of the study is explained in detail and arguments are provided about how it differs from previous literature on expatriates’ language learning motivation. The third chapter of the thesis consists of a review of the most important theories of second language learning motivation, that is Gardner’s socio-educational model, Deci and Ryan’s self determination theory and how Noels applied it to second language learning motivation, Higgin’s self discrepancy theory and Dornyei’s L2 motivation system. At the end of this chapter, the latest developments on L2 motivation theories and a dedicated review on the concept of Ideal Multilingual Self are presented. In Chapter 4, the specific research question addressed in this study is formulated and the details on the methodology and the questionnaire used as instrument are exposed. Chapter 5 deals with the findings of the study and it covers the data analysis, more specifically: reliability analysis, mean score analysis and correlation analysis. The final chapter of the thesis presents the conclusions and gives perspective on how the results of this work could be applied to positively influence English language learning motivation for the student group subject of this research.";

     speech.text = "1. Hi, my name is Alex Tarchini and this is the research that I did on motivation to study English, with the case in point being expats in an international city like Brussels 2. Let's start with a bit of a background on this research: study motivation has always been close to my heart because of my own experience as a student and because of the prospects of finding better opportunities abroad The objective of this study is to find out what motviates BXL expats to learn EN And here comes to the question of why this study – well, there is not much lit on expats (lang of the host country only, not EN as an intl lang) in summary main outcomes are: that Attitudes to learning EN & incentive values (instrumental motives and travel orientation) are the strongest factors, whereas Ideal L2 and Ought-to self did not directly correlate. 3. Now, let's talk about the organisation: 1. ch 1 is does intro and overview 2. ch 2 gives the context of the study 3. ch 3 presents the Lit Review on the theories in the field starting with Gardner's socio-educational model of L2 learning Self-determination Theory (Ryan and Deci) and how Noels applied in the context of lang learning motivation Higgin's self-descrepancy theory subchapter 4 does an overview of Dornyei's L2 self motivation system while subchapters 5 and 6discuss the latest developments in the field and the Ideal multilingual self 4. chapter 4 presents the research question and the methodology 5. chapter 5 discusses the results 6. and chapter 6 exposes the conclusions and gives some pedagogical applications 4. These are the main theories in the field of motivation studies: Gardner, Noels, Higgins, Dornyeis. And for this work I have used Dornyei's L2 motivation system as conceptual framework – This theory has been tested extensively, and the questionaire for it has been used both in large and small case studies. (Taguchi and Markova). And on top of it, it is the most promiment theory in recent years.. ....the 3 constructs are... 5. As the for the research question, it is stated exactly as “What are the L2 motivational characteritics of intl expats in Brussels who study EN as a 2nd lang”. 1. As for the methodology: the smaple size consisted of 40 foreign BXL exptats studying at the St Josse Language centre, age 20 to 58 (the majority were in the age group of 20-40), the respondents were from 3 different continents – Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Data collection took place May-June 2021 via a link to Google Forms. The instruments used was Taguchi's 2009 qiestionnaire and these are the variables. 6. Now, I will give you a very brief overview of the results: 1. the 1st graph shows the participants' coutnries of origin. 2. When it comes to the reliability anaylis, I used the Cronbach alpha as a measure for internal consistency of the scale (The rule is if Cronbach's alpha (b/n 0 and 1 – the questions used might not tap in the same entity) is less than 0.6 it means that the internal consitency of that variable). The vars that had to be excluded were “Integrativeness” & “ATTITUDE TWDS L2 COMMUNITY”. INTEGRATIVENESS”. The reason: Most likely it is because in BXL it is not easy to identify clearly the L2 EN speaking community. 7. Mean score analysis: 1. IN the meanscore analysis – the ideal L2 self and the vars related to it scored higher (instrumentality promo, ), while the ought-to and its vars scored lower (parental encouragement, instrumentality prevention), And this is consistent with other research done in the past. Separate – attitude twnds learnign EN – learning situation. - separate. 2. We see some similarities with previous studies – the vars related to ideal self got higher cored, 2. ethnocentrism and EN amxiety score low, but the mean value does not tell us much about how the different vars are related to the intended effort. Because of this I proceeded with the correlation analysis. 3. This is the correlation matrix and I identified the correlation coefficients at both 99 and 95% confidence (similar approach in Lit). Above 0.32 – 95%, above 0.4 it's 99% confidence. The treshhold for a sample of 40. 4. To interprete it I have created this summary 8. To summerise the results from the correlation matrix I made this chart: All these vars correlate with inteded effort at at least 95% confidence. The double-edged arrows indicate the intercorrelation b/n the vars at 99% confidence. So, it's easy to see what are the vars that are most correlated with the INTENDED EFFORT. Focusing on the green section – these 3 vars are intercorrelated with each other, and the coefficient is more or less the same. So it is fair to include them in one bigger dimension called INCENTIVE VALUES. Then I am also showing here, the underlined vars are correlated with Ought-to L2 self, while only the italics are also correlated with the Ideal L2 self. In my study, the Ideal L2 self did not come out as prominent – which is different from the literature, but this could be related to the profile of the respondents. Why instrumental motives: 1. age profile (older more instrumental motives); 2. expats typically have more instrumental motives; 3. in an int'l env. Maybe there is another self-guide; 9. The conclusion is that the strongest var is ATTITUDES TWD LEARNING EN, so my recommendation would be to make sure the whole EN learning experience is enjoyable, and provide lots of opps to network and socialise. 1. The 2nd strongest var is INCENTIVE VALUES – in this case my recommendation is to leverage the value students place on EN as means to expand their work, study, travel opps (e.g. By sharing success stories. QUESTIONS: Why Ideal and Ought to do not show in the diagram: they were not correlated with the intended effort at 95% confidence. Why not Ideal Multilingual self not included? - because it is a relatively new concept, which has been tested only in large scale studies so far, also not much literature on it. Pandemic impact on motivation to learn EN – my best guess is that this would motivate students to invest more efforts into learning EN, because in the condition of unemployment people need to upskill. That could be also a reason why I got these results of the questionnaire – the data collection took place during the pandemic (ideal L2 self did not come out as significant). There is a shift in terms of motivation focus – the pandemic is more extrinsic type of motivation Was the course online – my understanding is they started face to face, but because of the pandemic situation they finished the course online. My motivation drivers – learning situatution, inspiration from my EN teacher) and extrinsic (opportunities opening for me). Intrinsic – wanted to be like ,y sisters  ";

    speech.text = "2. Background II. Research Context 2.1 Background The study of language learning motivation can be useful for individual students and teachers, as well as the education system as a whole by aiding strategic decisions in the field of education and training. This research project attempts to provide a snapshot of the factors that motivate foreign language students to learn English, with expatriates in an international city such as Brussels as a case in point. The objective of the present research project is to report on the findings of a survey covering a sample of 40 expatriates studying English and to analyse their motivation. 2.2 Problem definition - why is motivation important? The concept of ‘motivation’ is often associated and explained with the desire to learn (Jodai, Zafarghandi & Tous, 2013). Not surprisingly, language learning motivation is “the second-best predictor of learners’ achievement scores, [the first being language aptitude]” (Gardner & Lambert, 1959, p. 266). However, while “language aptitude is predominantly seen as a matter of innate endowment and, correspondingly, considered to be relatively fixed, motivation is regarded as more subject to change” (Ellis, 2004, p. 534 as cited in Markova & Yaneva, 2020, p. 6). Therefore, language learning motivation as a significant factor in the language learning success outcomes attracts a great deal of research which could be beneficial for the education systems in general. In this study I have chosen to focus on the factors that motivate expatriates in Brussels to learn English. This study involves a sample limited to 40 expatriates, therefore the results must be taken with caution and may not be generalisable to different groups of expatriates. Expatriates or expats should not be confused with immigrants. According to the Oxford dictionary an expat is a “person living in a country that is not their own” (Expat Noun - Definition, Pictures, Pronunciation and Usage Notes | Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.Com, n.d.), while an immigrant is a “person who has come to live permanently in a different country from the one they were born in” (Immigrant Noun - Definition, Pictures, Pronunciation and Usage Notes | Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.Com, n.d.). The main difference between these two definitions is that immigrants have decided to move to a different country from their own permanently, whereas in the definition of expats the permanent nature of the sojourn abroad is not specified and the move abroad could be temporary. Other than being the place where I live in currently, Brussels is a very cosmopolitan city and there is a significantly large community of expatriates from all over the world, with approximately 70% of people of foreign origin (Brussels Population 2021 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs), 2021) also thanks to the many international institutions that have headquarters in the Belgian capital. This makes Brussels an obvious place where to conduct studies on expatriates. Brussels is in a bilingual region where the two official languages are French and Flemish. Nevertheless, in addition to the two official languages, “English is the most important school language” (Janssens, 2008, p. 3) and “is frequently used in an economic and cultural context” (Janssens, 2008, p. 3). As such, a sufficient level of English is required to connect and integrate in the international community living in the city and with other expatriates. Therefore, expatriates arriving in Brussels may need to attend English courses to improve their English to integrate in the international community. Moreover, given the usually temporary nature of their stay abroad, expats may value global English more than the host country official languages, as global English could still be useful once their sojourn in Brussels ends and they are ready to move on to a different country. There are very few publications in literature that study L2 motivation among expatriates, yet there has been a growing number of expatriates and mobile students in the past years (Tarp, 2020). This particular group of people needs to know at least one second language on top of their mother tongue to be able to effectively communicate with people from different backgrounds and successfully settle in the host country. As Tarp (2020) explains it, “increasing cross-cultural interaction has accentuated the importance of enhancing learners’ proficiency to communicate with people from various cultural backgrounds” (p. 272). The publications available in literature having expatriates as target group focus on the motivation to learn the language of the host country. For instance, the aforementioned research from Tarp (2020) has the objective to determine the factors relating to willingness to communicate (WTC) in Danish for expatriates in Denmark. This study concludes that the WTC in Danish is affected by many different factors including the type of international encounters the expatriate experiences, personal ties or common interests with people from the host country, and the expatriate’s self-esteem. The author suggests that English proficiency may have opposite effects on WTC in Danish. On one hand, it would help on WTC in Danish, since it is easier to learn a third language (Danish) if one is already proficient in a second language (English), on the other hand, it may hinder the WTC in Danish, as being proficient in English can be enough to cope with life and settle in the country as most Danes can also speak fluently in English. The research work from Zhang and Harzing (2016) focuses on the motivation of expatriates working in multinational corporations to learn the language of the host country (in this case Chinese) and how the willingness to learn Chinese and the language proficiency relate to the expatriate/host country employee (HCE) relationship. The authors have found that the language learning motivation for the target group of expatriates in question is mainly instrumental (i.e. learning the language from the host country can help in accelerating their career). Moreover, depending on the willingness to learn Chinese and language proficiency perceived by the host country employees, the relationship between the expatriates and host country employees could be harmonious, with high trust and closer interpersonal relationship (if expatriates showed good willingness to learn and proficiency), or distant (if expatriates showed good willingness to learn but low proficiency), characterised by lower trust as host country employees are suspicious about the real effort expatriates put into learning the language, or segregated (if expatriates did not show any willingness to learn), with no trust, as the host country employees feel entitled to speak their own language and socially exclude expatriates in this case. The study from Froese (2012) highlights the importance for expatriates to learn the language of the host country to adjust to the country where they live in (South Korea in the case of this study). Lack of host language proficiency had negative repercussions mainly on general adjustment (communication difficulties limited and complicated expatriates’ daily lives) and interaction adjustment (lack of social life which is regretted by the expatriates interviewed in the study). Proficiency in English as lingua franca, i.e. a “shared language of communication used between people whose main languages are different” (Lingua-Franca Noun - Definition, Pictures, Pronunciation and Usage Notes | Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.Com, n.d.), was sufficient for an acceptable adjustment at work, but not sufficient when it comes to general and interaction adjustments. As mentioned, the studies presented above focus on expatriates’ motivation to learn the language of the host country and none of them focuses on English. This master thesis research study has the objective to study expatriates’ motivation to learn English as international language rather than the language of the host country. This has not been tackled in previous publications and could provide new insights on expatriates’ motivation to learn a second language. Given the multicultural nature of Brussels, which gathers 179 nationalities (More than One in Three Inhabitants of Brussels Is Not Belgian, 2018), there is no dominant language group that could be associated to the host country language. Therefore, Brussels is particularly suitable to conduct a research on motivation to learn English as international language.";

    speech.text = "3. Theoretical Overview III. Theoretical Overview The study of foreign language motivation has been attracting a lot of interest throughout the years. This chapter presents the main theories explaining motivation, namely: Gardner’s socio-educational model (Gardner & Lambert, 1959; Gardner, 1960, 2007), Noels’ model (Noels, Pelletier, Clément & Vallerand, 2003) based on Deci and Ryan’s self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), Higgins’ self discrepancy theory (Higgins, 1998), Dornyei's Second Language (L2) motivation self-system (Dornyei & Kormos, 2000; Dornyei, 2009; Dornyei & Chan, 2013; Dornyei & Kubanyiova, 2014; Dornyei & Ryan, 2015) and the latest theoretical developments originating from it (Dornyei, 2019). The next sections present these theories in more detail, while the last section expands on the concept of Ideal Multilingual Self. One clarification of terms is needed before proceeding further. In literature sometimes the term “second language” is found, whereas other times authors use “foreign language”. Second language refers to a language which is readily available or has political importance in the community or country in question. That is the case of French in Canada, for example. Foreign language, on the other hand, is not readily available or lacks political importance in the community or country. For the case of my research project, I will use the term “second language” for English in Brussels, as English is extensively present and used in economic and cultural contexts in the Belgian capital (see the previous subchapter). 3.1 Gardner’s socio-educational model of second language learning Robert Gardner’s socio-educational model of second language learning attempts to predict what determines the positive achievement of learning a second language. His model postulates that second language learning achievement is determined by two factors: ability and motivation. These two factors do not necessarily correlate with each other. In particular, at parity ability a student with higher motivation will likely be more successful in learning a second language and at parity motivation, a student with higher ability will likely be more successful in learning a second language. Additionally, second language learning achievement is interconnected with anxiety, in the sense that a high achievement will contribute to lower the levels of anxiety, and high levels of anxiety will contribute to lower likelihood of achievement (Gardner, 2011). According to Gardner, motivation and ability both play a very important role on second language learning achievement and depending on the learning context one of these two factors may have a bigger impact than the other. More specifically, in formal learning contexts (e.g. school, classroom, teachers) motivation and ability are equally important for learning achievement, while in informal learning contexts (for example learning a second language through listening to the radio or language clubs), motivation is a bigger driver than ability on second language learning (Gardner, 2011). In fact, a student with very low motivation in learning a second language would not even engage in activities, beyond the formal education, that would require him or her to spend effort to acquire the language. One other important difference between motivation and ability is that motivation can be influenced by the educational situation and the cultural context, while ability cannot (Gardner, 2011) as it is a characteristic exclusively pertaining to the student. Given this, teachers aspiring to have a successful language learning experience for their students would need to devise ways to increase their motivation. According to Gardner, motivation is a multi-faceted concept, and it is impossible to describe it with only one dimension. In particular, “the motivated individual is goal directed, expends effort, is persistent, is attentive, has desires (wants), exhibits positive affect, is aroused, has expectancies, demonstrates self-confidence (self-efficacy), and has reasons (motives)” (Gardner, 2007, p.10). Therefore, motivation encompasses a desire, persistence and effort to learn the language as well as the affective reactions (emotions) that generate as a result of the learning experience. Gardner’s socio-educational model also establishes what factors determine motivation. These are: attitudes towards the learning situation, integrativeness and instrumentality. Attitudes towards the learning situation “includes all variables that can be linked directly to the educational system and the experiences associated with the educational environment.” (Gardner, 2007, p. 15). Integrativeness refers to the “individual being interested in learning the language in order to interact with valued members of the other community and/or to learn more about that community” (Gardner, 2007, p. 15) and it can also involve “an open interest in other cultural communities in general” (Gardner, 2007, p. 15). Integrativeness should not be confused with integrative orientations. The integrative orientations refer to “a desire to learn the L2 in order to have contact with, and perhaps to identify with, members from the L2 community” (Noels et al., 2003, p. 36). The integrative orientations are only part of integrativeness which is a bigger construct including also the interest in the foreign language and positive attitudes towards the L2 community on top of the integrative orientations. Instrumentality refers to the desire to be able to work and advance in the career thanks to the acquired language skills (Gardner & Lambert, 1959). Unlike integrativeness, instrumentality can be completely identified with instrumental orientations. More specifically, instrumental orientations constitute the only scale used to measure instrumentality, while integrativeness is not measured only through the integrative orientations scale but also through other two scales, i.e.: interest in foreign languages and attitudes towards the language community (more details in the description of the Attitude/Motivation Test Battery below). According to this theoretical framework, attitudes towards the learning situation and integrativeness are better predictors of motivation than instrumentality. In particular, integrativeness has a very strong influence on motivation according to Gardner, because it is strictly related to the concept of identification (Mowrer, 1950), that is the “tendency for the child to copy the parent particularly in the parents’ absence” (Gardner, 1960, p. 8) and is critical in the process of first language learning. One other important concept defined in Gardner’s model is the concept of integrative motive. Integrative motive can be seen as the aggregate of the three concepts: attitudes towards the learning situation, integrativeness and motivation. Students that have a positive attitude towards the learning situation, are high in integrativeness and are highly motivated have a high integrative motive. Integratively motivated students are keen in emotionally getting closer to the target language community (Gardner, 2011). The figure below (Gardner, 2011) gives an overview of Gardner’s socio-educational model of second language learning highlighting the relationships among the different concepts. Figure 1 – Overview of Gardner’s socio-educational model of second language learning and relations among concepts The AMTB (Attitude/Motivation Test Battery) is the instrument used by Gardner to measure all the conceptual components of the socio-educational model of second language learning represented in the overview above. The AMTB provides different scales to describe each concept. These are summarised in the table below. Variable in socio-educational model Scales used Attitudes towards the learning situation -Evaluation of English Teacher -Evaluation of English Course Integrativeness -Integrative Orientation -Interest in Foreign Languages -Attitudes towards the language community Instrumentality -Instrumental Orientation Motivation -Motivation Intensity -Desire to learn the language -Attitudes towards learning the language Anxiety -Language Class Anxiety -Language Use Anxiety Table 1: Scales used in the socio-educational model of second language acquisition Upon testing the model through a meta-analysis conducted by Gardner and associates (Masgoret & Gardner, 2003), the authors found that all of the concepts postulated in the model as influencing language achievement (attitudes towards the learning situation, integrativeness, instrumentality and motivation) were all positively correlated with the language achievement, measured through grades, objective tests and self ratings. Moreover, the variable motivation had the highest correlation with the language achievement, in particular higher than both the correlation between integrativeness and language achievement and the correlation between attitudes towards the learning situation and language achievement. This supports the idea that though integrativeness and attitudes towards the learning situation do impact the achievements in learning a second language, they act through motivation. This study also showed that instrumental motives had the lowest correlation with achievement, though still positively correlated. This confirmed the hypothesis that integratively motivated students are in a better position to learn foreign languages (Gardner & Lambert, 1959), however, given that instrumentality was also positively correlated with motivation and language learning achievements, it should also be noted that these two types of motivation are not mutually exclusive (Gardner & Lambert, 1959). The socio-educational model was developed by Gardner based on the example of the language community of French Canadians acquiring English as a second language. Later on, when Gardner and associates tried to elaborate the model further and expand its validity to other contexts (i.e. outside of the language community solely), they decided that it would be useful to distinguish two other types of motivation within the integrative motivation – namely integrative and assimilative. The assimilative motivation constitutes just a much stronger form of integrative motivation, which drives students to acquire language to such a level that they would speak the language as a native speaker (Gardner, 1972). Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that integrative language motivation could be treated not only as a positive driving factor, but also as a negative one, because there could be cases when learners do not really have the inner desire to integrate with the target language community owing to various reasons (Daskalovska, Koleva & Ivanovska, 2011). For example, some Indians could be reluctant to study English because of negative associations with colonial past, or some Belgian Walloons might feel forced to study Flemish at school and would often be reluctant to speak Flemish because of the perceived low usefulness of the language. In the latter case Walloon students would typically not have a particularly high assimilative motivation when it comes to learning Flemish. Nevertheless, the expanded version of the model containing instrumental, integrative and assimilative motivation still received further criticism. The major criticism was that Gardner's model was based on second language learning in bilingual countries, where there is a significant availability and socio-political importance of the second language, and as such its applicability in broader contexts would be limited - e.g. foreign language learning (Klein, 1997), where there is little availability of the second (or foreign) language. Thus, Gardner and his colleagues adapted it for a third time to make the model reflect also the importance of the foreign language classroom aspect. Another criticism that the model received was that it was extremely western-based and addresses issues that are mainly common for western social contexts (Klein, 1997). One of the most prominent criticisms was related to the distinction between instrumental and integrative motivation, and in particular the claim that integrative motivation is more powerful when it comes to effective language learning (Klein, 1997). In fact, a number of studies conducted in Eastern Asia in societies known for their hard-working values (Chee & Ganapathy, 2017) pointed out that actually in many cases instrumental motivation was more powerful for success in language learning - which does not correspond to the model that Gardner suggested. As a consequence, Gardner tried again to adjust the model to more global situations. Notwithstanding its undeniable influence in the field of motivation studies, Gardner's model is still questioned when it comes to the distinction between integrative and instrumental orientation in some foreign language learning contexts, its failure to acknowledge the influence of success in language learning on motivation, and the lack of clear implications for foreign language pedagogy (Ellis, 2004). 3.2 Self-Determination Theory Not surprisingly, Gardner's model/paradigm spurred further research on the topic of motivation. Noels et al.‘s (2003) proposal was originally based on Deci and Ryan’s (1985) self-determination theory. An important aspect of Deci and Ryan's self-determination theory is the distinction between two general types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic. Adapting Deci and Ryan’s theory specifically to foreign or second language learning, Noels characterises the intrinsic motivation as based on the interest in learning the language and on the positive emotions and sensations deriving from the language learning process. A student who is intrinsically motivated to learn a second language is willing to engage in the learning process because he or she finds it an enjoyable and satisfying activity to do (Noels et al., 2003). On the other hand, extrinsic motivation is based on external factors. In particular, ‘‘extrinsically motivated behaviours are those actions carried out to achieve some instrumental end, such as earning a reward or avoiding a punishment‘‘ (Noels et al., 2003, p. 39). Noels et al. (2003) define three types of intrinsic motivation (IM): IM-knowledge - “the motivation for doing an activity for the feelings associated with exploring new ideas and developing knowledge” (p. 38), IM-accomplishment - “the sensations related to attempting to master a task or achieve a goal” (p. 38), and IM-stimulation - “motivation based simply on the sensations stimulated by performing the task, such as aesthetic appreciation or fun and excitement.” (p. 38). Furthermore, Noels' model also distinguishes three types of extrinsic motivation (Noels et al., 2003): EM-external regulation - “activities that are determined by sources external to the person” (p. 39), EM-introjected regulation “reasons that pertain to performing an activity due to some type of pressure that individuals have incorporated into the self” (p. 39), and EM-identified regulation - “individuals invest energy in an activity because they have chosen to do so for personally relevant reasons” (p. 39). These three types of extrinsic motivation are presented in order of increasing self-determination. The external regulation is the least self-determined form of EM in the sense that if the external factor determining the motivation to learn a second language was removed, the learning process would just stop as there would be no more reason to spend any effort on it. The introjected regulation is more self-determined than the external regulation because in this case the push to learn a second language comes as a response to “some type of pressure that the individual has incorporated into the self, such that they compel to carry out that activity” (Noels et al., 2003, p. 39). This is not the most self-determined type of EM because the pressure, though internal, is still responding to external influences. The most self-determined type of EM is the identified regulation. In this case the reasons to engage in the learning process are fully internalised and “students would carry out the activity because of its importance for achieving a valued goal” (Noels et al., 2003, p.39). The figure below represents the different types of language learning motivation and how they position in the self-determination continuum. Figure 2: Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation types and their position in the self determination continuum Noels et al. (2003) attempted to use these six motivation types and four types of orientations (travel, knowledge, friendship and instrumental orientations) to predict motivation in second language learning. In particular, the authors used as criterion measurements antecedents (self-perceived competence and freedom of choice) and consequences (anxiety and intention to continue) of motivation. These are psychological constructs differentially related to various aspects of motivation. More precisely, in the field of statistics, antecedents are variables that explain the behaviour of other variables, whereas consequences are variables whose behaviour is explained by other variables. A variable’s significant positive correlation with perceived competence, freedom of choice and intention to continue and significant negative correlation with anxiety indicate that the variable positively influences motivation. To note that integrative orientation (one key concept of Gardner’s socio-educational model of second language learning) is not included in the study. The authors admitted having regretted this choice: “my only regret with this study is that I did not include a scale to measure the integrative orientation (Gardner, 1985) to determine its relation with the SDT subtypes” (Noels et al., 2003, p. 35). One of the key findings of this study is that more self-determined types of motivation correlate better with the antecedents and consequences of motivation compared with less self-determined types. Also, for what matters the orientations, the study found that the travel, knowledge and friendship orientations correlated best with more self-determined types of motivation, while the instrumental orientation correlated best with less self-determined types of motivation (e.g. the external regulation). These conclusions are quite in line also with Gardner’s socio-educational model of second language learning, if one identifies the integrative motive with more self-determined types of motivation and the instrumental orientations with less self-determined types of motivation (the latter identification is even supported by the data from the study in question). Though the general trend is that more self-determined types of motivation are more closely linked with the antecedents and consequences of motivation, it was the identified regulation which correlated best with them. This led the authors to the conclusion that it may be not enough to present the experience of learning a second language as an enjoyable and satisfying activity to do to persuade students to learn (i.e., leveraging on their intrinsic motivation). It is also important to convince students that second language learning is very important personally for them (i.e. leveraging on the identified regulation). 3.3 Higgins’ self-discrepancy theory One important theoretical framework in which motivation has been studied and researched is Higgins’ self discrepancy theory (Higgins, 1998). Higgins distinguishes between two types of self-regulating systems: self-regulating systems with a positive reference and self-regulating systems with a negative reference. A self-regulating system with a positive reference is a system that tries to reduce the discrepancy between the actual state and a desired end state, whereas a self-regulating system with a negative reference is a system that tries to amplify the discrepancy between the actual state and an undesired end state (Higgins, 1998). In this context, motivation is an example of a self-regulating system with a positive reference and its goal is to reduce the discrepancy between the perception of the current self and the desired end states, which are also called self guides. Higgins hypothesises the existence of two different types of self guides: the ideal self and the ought self. The ideal selves are “individuals’ representations of the attributes that someone (themselves or another person) would like them ideally to possess, someone’s hopes, wishes, or aspirations for them” (Higgins, 1998, p. 3). The ought selves, on the other hand, are “individuals’ representations of the attributes that someone believes they should or ought to possess, someone’s beliefs about their duties, obligations, or responsibilities” (Higgins, 1998, p. 3). According to Higgins, the type of self guide (ideal or ought) also determines the self regulation strategy that is used to reduce the discrepancy between the current and the final end state. In other words, the ideal and ought self guides are motivationally distinct desired end states. In particular, the following four aspects: sensitivity to psychological situations, self-regulation strategies, emotion triggered by the discrepancy and self-regulation focus differ greatly between the two self guides. Specifically: “the psychological situations involved in ideal self-regulation are the presence and absence of positive outcomes” (Higgins, 1998, p. 4) and “the psychological situations involved in ought self-regulation are the absence and presence of negative outcomes” (Higgins, 1998, p. 5). This is because “the hopes, wishes, and aspirations represented in ideal self-guides function like maximal goals. In contrast, the duties, obligations, and responsibilities represented in ought self-guides function more like minimal goals” (Higgins, 1998, p. 5). For what concerns the different self-regulating strategies “individuals can increase the likelihood that they will attain (or maintain) a desired end state, that is, reduce discrepancies, by either approaching matches to that end state or avoiding mismatches to that end state” (Higgins, 1998, p. 7). In this context the strategy of approaching a match pertains to the ideal self guide, while the strategy of avoiding a mismatch pertains to the ought self guide. The discrepancy between the current perceived self and the self guide can trigger different emotions depending on the type of self guide (ideal or ought). According to Higgins, a discrepancy between current self and ideal self is more likely to trigger dejection types of emotions (disappointment, dissatisfaction, sadness), whereas a discrepancy between current self and ought self is more likely to trigger agitation types of emotions (feeling uneasy, threatened, afraid). In terms of self-regulation focus, the ideal self is related to the presence of a promotion focus, while the ought self to the presence of a prevention focus. The table below summarises the various aspects that differentiate the ideal and ought self guides. Self guide Ideal self Ought self Sensitivity to psychological situations Absence/presence of positive outcomes Absence/presence of negative outcomes Self-regulation strategies Approaching a match Avoiding a mismatch Emotions triggered by discrepancy Dejection (disappointment, dissatisfaction, sadness) Agitation (feeling uneasy, threatened, afraid) Self-regulation focus Promotion focus Prevention focus Table 2. Motivational distinction between ideal and ought self guides 3.4 Dornyei's L2 Self Motivation System Another prominent proposal in the field of language learning motivation studies is Zoltan Dörnyei’s Second Language (L2) Motivational Self System (Dornyei & Kormos, 2000; Dornyei, 2009; Dornyei & Chan, 2013; Dornyei & Kubanyiova, 2014; Dornyei & Ryan, 2015). Dornyei's Motivation theory is largely based on Gardner and Lambert's (1959) concept of integrative motivation, the study of ‘possible selves’ (Markus & Nurius, 1986) and ‘future self guides’ (Higgins, 1998) in mainstream psychology. Dornyei's L2 Motivational Self System theory established three different types of language learning motivation. The first being the ideal L2 self, i.e. the person we would like to become using the target language, or in short what we really want to be. The other part of language learning motivation according to Dornyei is the so called ‘ought-to L2 Self’ - this is what language users learners have to become (it is concerned with duties, responsibilities, associations with standards in society, expectations, the desire to live up to certain expectation). Therefore, the factors here are more extrinsic, and not so internalised as in the ones that go under the umbrella term of ‘Ideal L2 Self’. The third factor is the ‘L2 Learning Experience’, which covers all the various circumstances and situations that happen in the classroom and that influence motivation – factors such as teacher, curriculum, the class as a group, group dynamics, peer pressure, experience of success. Dornyei's theory was the first proposal in the field to include this aspect of language learning experience. Dornyei added this component to take into account the results of previous research on L2 learning motivation, pointing to the classroom learning situation as having a significant influence on L2 learning motivation. I also felt that we needed to add a third major constituent, which is associated with the direct impact of the students’ learning environment. After all, one of the main achievements of the new wave of motivational studies in the 1990s was to recognize the motivational impact of the main components of the classroom learning situation, such as the teacher, the curriculum and the learner group. For some language learners the initial motivation to learn a language does not come from internally or externally generated self-images but rather from successful engagement with the actual language learning process (e.g., because they discover that they are good at it). (Dörnyei, 2009, p. 29). No other previous theory had considered this aspect as relevant in predicting motivation in second language learning success outcomes. Dörnyei (2009) points out that the three key elements of the L2 Motivational Self System (ideal L2 self, ought-to L2 self and L2 learning experience) are similar to the three areas of integrativeness, instrumentality and attitude towards the learning situation that are part of the Attitude/Motivation Test Battery in one of the later versions of Gardner's socio-psychological model (Masgoret & Gardner, 2003). Moreover, Dornyei suggests that his L2 Motivational Self System is also in line with Noels' theory, as there are some similarities between Dörnyei's ideal L2 self, ought-to L2 self and L2 learning experience and Noels’ identified regulation, introjected regulation and intrinsic motivation respectively. The figure below graphically represents Dornyei’s model of L2 self motivation. Figure 3: Representation of Dornyei’s model of L2 self motivation. One key difference between Dornyei’s L2 self motivation theory and Gardner’s socio-educational model of second language learning is that Dornyei focuses on the intended effort and language choice for future studies as best measures of motivation, which is what the model attempts to predict, while Gardner tries to predict language achievement as criterion measure. The criterion measure is the variable whose drivers the study tries to understand, that is the variable which one needs to identify how all other variables relate to. In their study on 13-14 year-old pupils attending the final grade of primary school in Hungary, Csizer and Dornyei (2005) conclude that intended effort and language choice for future studies are better measures for motivation than achievement as “motivation is a concept that explains why people behave as they do rather than how successful their behaviour will be” (Csizer & Dornyei, 2005, p. 20). In the same study, the authors conclude, using structural equation model techniques, that integrativeness (a construct from Gardner’s model) is the only directly related factor to intended effort or language choice. However, Dornyei points out that integrativeness should be re-interpreted under the broader concept of Ideal L2 self and relabelled as such. In fact, in the context of this study (Hungary) the second language (English) was not really present or sufficiently available in the country at the time of the research, therefore it does not really make sense that English language students’ motivation is fuelled by their willingness to integrate with the English-speaking community with who they do not really have much contact. Moreover, in Csizer and Dornyei’s (2005) study, the structural equation model highlighted that attitudes towards L2 community and instrumentality were both antecedents of integrativeness. This further confirms Dornyei’s conviction that integrativeness should be replaced by Ideal L2 self when trying to predict motivational behaviour. The Ideal L2 self could still include instrumental motives on top of integrative motives, though the instrumental motives would only be the ones with a promotion focus (instrumental motives with a prevention focus being part of the Ought-to L2 self). In other words “in our idealized image of ourselves we may want to be not only personally agreeable but also professionally successful” (Csizer & Dornyei, 2005, p. 29). This is another key difference between Dornyei’s and Gardner’s models. According to Dörnyei (2009), his L2 Motivational Self System theory is also consistent with other motivational frameworks, such as Ushioda’s (2001) motivation construct. Taking a qualitative research approach, Ema Ushioda introduces eight motivation elements in her model, namely: academic interest, language-related enjoyment/liking, desired levels of L2 competence, personal goals, positive learning history, personal satisfaction, feelings about L2 speaking countries and people, and external pressures and incentives. Dörnyei argues that these eight elements could be reorganised in three bigger groups: actual learning process, external pressures/incentives, and integrative disposition. These three groups are similar to the three components of the L2 Motivational Self System. The L2 Motivational Self System has been tested multiple times and validated in different contexts, including six different countries, various learner groups (urban versus rural background, English versus non-English university students, various age groups) with a total number of participants of over 16 500 (Csizér & Kormos, 2009; Taguchi, Magid & Papi, 2009; Lamb, 2012; You & Dörnyei, 2016). As previously mentioned, Dornyei argued about the existence of similarities between the L2 Motivational Self System and previous motivational theories (Gardner's and Noels’). Other authors also agree with this view (Taguchi et al., 2009). As a consequence, previous research results applicable to Gardner's and Noel's theories could also be applicable to the L2 Motivational Self System and drive new meaningful insights to strengthen this theory. Other authors have tried to expand on Dornyei’s L2 Motivational Self System and to break down the concepts of Ideal L2 self and Ought-to L2 self into four self guides: Ideal L2 self/own, Ideal L2 self/others, Ought-to L2 self/own and Ought-to L2 self/others (Teimouri, 2016). Teimouri clearly explains the meaning of these four self guides: (a) ideal self/ own, which represents the attributes one hopes or aspires to possess; (b) ideal self/others, which represents attributes one believes others would like him or her, ideally, to possess; (c) ought self/own, which represents attributes one should or ought to possess; and (d) ought self/others, which represent attributes one should or ought to possess because others expect them to do so. (Teimouri, 2016, p. 687). The author states that Dornyei’s theory focuses only on the Ideal L2 self/own and Ought-to L2 self/others and does not account for the other two possible self guides. Teimouri’s study was conducted on 12–18 year-old adolescent learners of English from junior and senior high schools in Iran and it found that the ideal L2 self/own and ideal L2 self/others could not be distinguished, whereas the ought-to L2 self/own and the ought-to L2 self/others could. Therefore, only three self guides were kept in the study: Ideal L2 self, Ought-to L2 self/own and Ought-to L2 self/others. Teimouri (2016) found that the Ideal L2 self best predicts motivation (expressed under the criterion measures of intended effort and willingness to continue L2 studies) and the ought-to L2 self/others was the least correlated with the criterion measure. Teimouri (2016) also investigated which emotions (among joy, anxiety and shame) are likely to be experienced in students during the learning process considering the different self guides. The author found that joy is experienced in students with an Ideal L2 self guide, which is in line with the promotion focus of the Ideal L2 self, whereas anxiety is experienced in students with an Ought-to L2 self/others guide, which can benefit motivation in students with a prevention focus, as “anxiety fits prevention-focused learners in stimulating them to expand more vigilant efforts to avoid the presence of negative outcomes. Thus, it is beneficial for their motivation” (Teimouri, 2016 p. 689). Shame is never beneficial to motivation as it leads to withdrawal and avoidance because of fear to experience negative emotions. It is experienced at some point by all students regardless of the self guide, however the correlation with shame is strongest in the Ought-to L2 self/others and weakest in the Ideal L2 self. The two figures below represent Teimouri’s findings on the Ideal and Ought-to L2/own and others self guides and their relationships with motivation and emotions. Figure 4: Self-guides relationships with motivational variables (width of arrows represents strength of correlation) Figure 5: Self-guides relationships with emotions experienced during learning process (width of arrows represents strength of correlation) The studies mentioned so far have shown the strength and usefulness of Dornyei’s L2 self motivation system. On the other hand though, there have also been studies that have revealed some weaknesses in Dornyei's theory. For instance, Lamb (2012) used Dornyei’s L2 self motivational system to predict the motivated behaviour (intended effort) and proficiency of Indonesian 13-14 year-old junior high school pupils learning English in different geographical areas i.e. metropolitan city, provincial town and rural area. One of the outcomes of the study was the failure to even properly measure the Ought-to L2 self, given the low reliability of the scale. This may be due to the fact that the respondents were too young, and so not yet capable of incorporating the pressure from the external environment (which is an important component of the Ought-to L2 self guide) within the self. Moreover, the Ideal L2 self was correlating with the motivated behaviour only for the students in the metropolitan city, and not for the ones in the provincial town and rural area. This result led the author to conclude that “the effort that pupils put into learning English is more susceptible to immediate contextual factors than to their visions of a future self” (Lamb, 2012, pp. 1014–1015), which seems to suggest that Dornyei’s theory is not generalisable to all contexts. In addition to that, Lamb concluded that in the context of his study, proficiency in second language acquisition was mainly driven by the geographical situation, which most likely influences material accessibility and quality of teachers. Furthermore, Csizér & Kormos (2009) found a lack of correlation between the ought-to L2 self and the motivated behaviour on a sample of Hungarian secondary school students from Budapest, 16.5 years old on average. According to the authors this may be due to how the ought-to L2 self is measured. As a result, Taguchi, Magid and Papi offered a potential solution by implementing more detailed ways to measure this element, in particular by including different types of external factors and handling them separately (Taguchi et al., 2009; Dornyei & Chan, 2013). More precisely, Taguchi's questionnaire added scales addressing promotional and preventional instrumental motives. They are both types of external factors attempting to measure the ought-to L2 self, however the former employs questions framed in a promotional way (“Studying English can be important to me because I think it will someday be useful in getting a good job and/or making money“) while the latter in a preventive way (“I have to study English; otherwise, I think I cannot be successful in my future career“). Likewise, scales addressing affective factors (e.g. fear of assimilation or anxiety) are added in attempt to extract more aspects of the ought-to L2 self in a more complete manner (Taguchi et al., 2009). The study of Taguchi et al. (2009) used the L2 self motivation system to predict the motivated behaviour of students in different countries, namely Japan, China and Iran and to assess if the theory is robust across different cultural contexts. The sample employed in this study was very diverse and it was including middle school, university students and working professionals (for the Chinese sample only) with a pretty wide age range (the widest range being 11 to 53 year old for the Chinese sample). This study confirmed that the key aspects of Dornyei’s model hold in all three countries. In particular, the Ideal L2 self showed a significant correlation with the criterion measure (intended effort) and higher than the correlation between integrativeness and the criterion measure. This confirms the hypothesis that the Ideal L2 self concept can better explain motivated behaviour than the integrativeness from Gardner’s socio-educational model. Additionally, the Ideal L2 self and integrativeness were positively correlated between each other, showing that they both tap in the same construct. However, given the Ideal L2 self can better explain the criterion measure, it can replace integrativeness. One other important conclusion relates to the two different types of instrumental motives (promotional and preventional) that were measured through the questionnaire. These two types of instrumental motives did not correlate with each other, showing that they represent distinct aspects of instrumentality. The correlation between instrumentality-promotion and Ideal L2 self was higher than the one between instrumentality-prevention and Ideal L2 self, and also the correlation between instrumentality-prevention and Ought-to L2 self was higher than the one between instrumentality-promotion and Ought-to L2 self. This is what one would expect given the promotional focus of the ideal L2 self guide and the preventional focus of the Ought-to L2 self guide. In all three countries the attitudes towards learning English and the Ideal L2 self were explaining the intended effort, and the Ideal L2 self was highly correlated with the attitudes towards the L2 community and instrumentality-promotion. This confirms the point that the Ideal L2 self is “not only personally agreeable but also professionally successful” (Csizer & Dornyei, 2005, p. 29) and that students with an Ideal L2 self guide are the highest motivated ones, in accordance with the theoretical predictions. In this respect, this study was successful in confirming the key principles of the L2 self motivation system and the suitability of the questionnaire used as instrument. 3.5 Latest developments in L2 learning motivation theories All theories presented so far have tried to explain what promotes motivation in second language acquisition. L2 motivation researchers have also used theories from cognitive psychology (self determination, possible selves, self discrepancy theory) to understand L2 motivation. There have also been attempts of studies in the field of neuro-biology to explain motivation, but they have failed. There are still a few aspects of motivation that are not accounted for in the current theories and should be included in the study of L2 motivation to more completely describe this concept. One concept that was proposed to extend the L2 self motivation system is the concept of ‘Ideal multilingual self’ (Ushioda, 2017). This concept describes the desire to become multilingual, and it can be a very strong motivational force on top of the self guides and orientations already included in Dornyei’s theory. According to Henry and Cliffordson (2017) in case of highly globalised contexts there is not enough discrepancy between the current perceived self and the ideal L2 English specific self guide, therefore the Ideal L2 self guide might not be able to explain motivated behaviour in these contexts. Further to that it has been pointed out that motivation so far has been studied only at individual level and not at a group level, whereas group dynamics (in particular group cohesiveness and group norms) could have a significant impact on learners’ motivation (Chang, 2010). One other very important observation is that all current theories represent motivation in second language learning acquisition as static, which is actually not the case. This is due to the research methods applied in the studies conducted to test the theories, which are cross-sectional (i.e. focusing on how different factors relate to each other and to language learning motivation for different target groups at a certain point in time) rather than longitudinal (following the evolution over time of the language learning motivation and factors relating to it of specific target groups). Motivation is dynamic as students go through ups and downs in motivation during the learning process. Also motivation, cognition and emotions are interrelated to each other in a dynamic way, continuously evolving in time (Buck, 2005). The use of complex system dynamic principles would be needed to study and understand the temporal dimension of motivation. In addition, new psychological theories can help to include the dynamic dimension of motivation and other learners’ characteristics. In this respect, Dornyei and Ryan (2015) have considered the “Big Five model” from McAdams & Pals (2006) “which offers a broad theoretical framework that can be used to explain contextual and temporal variation accompanied by dynamic interactions at various levels” (Dörnyei, 2019, p. 52). This model includes three key personality traits (among a total of five) that can be relevant in the study of motivation in second language acquisition. These are: dispositional traits, “referring to relatively stable and decontextualised broad dimensions of individual differences” (Dörnyei, 2019, p. 53) characteristic adaptations, “referring to constructs that are highly contextualised in time, place and/or social role” (Dörnyei, 2019, p. 53) integrative life narratives, “referring to internalised and evolving life stories that reconstruct the past and imagine the future to provide a person’s life with identity (unity, purpose, meaning)” (Dörnyei, 2019, p. 53). Dornyei (2019) points out that there is not much research yet on the third aspect of integrative life narratives. The inclusion of the integrative life narratives could provide the dynamic aspect missing in the current L2 self motivation system. In fact, other authors have pointed out that at least three dynamic processes could intervene in the temporal evolution of the self guides (Dornyei, 2019). These processes are: the up- and downward revisions of the ideal and ought-to selfdimensions changes triggered by their interaction with other selfconcepts other qualitative and quantitative changes in the imagery that underlies possible L2 selves Some authors, like Henry and Cliffordson (2017), have suggested that including the “current self” variable in research studies could help understand the dynamic behaviour of the self guides (Dornyei, 2019). Also, understanding the dynamic interactions between self guides may be even more relevant in case of learning more than one language at a time (Henry, 2010). A relevant aspect to consider when studying motivation in second language acquisition, taking into account its temporal nature, is what sustains motivation in the long term, in addition to what generates motivation, given second language acquisition can be a slow process. To answer this question, Dornyei proposes three concepts: vision, directed motivational currents and student engagement (Dornyei, 2019). A vision is a very powerful and highly personalised goal, however “the added component also includes a vivid mental image of the experience of successfully accomplishing the goal” (Dornyei, 2019, p. 58). This should not be confused with the concept of self-concordant goal, which is also a very personalised goal, but does not include the mental image component, which is present in the vision. It is suggested that vision is one of the most reliable predictors of long-term motivational behaviour (Dörnyei & Kubanyiova, 2014). A directed motivational current is a powerful motivational drive which unfolds over time and impacts its participants in a significant way (Dornyei, 2019). This is closely linked to self-concordant goals and visions, complex dynamic systems and long-term motivation. Simply speaking, directed motivational currents happen when learners are fully absorbed in the subject of the study to the point that they keep thinking about it all the time, and they cannot get it out of their head. Student engagement refers to active participation and involvement in schooling activities and academic tasks (Dornyei, 2019). Student engagement is required in addition to motivation to ensure long term success in second language acquisition. This is particularly relevant in modern society where there is such a great number of distractions (especially social media) competing to grasp students’ attention. Even though a student is highly motivated and shows a positive attitude towards second language acquisition, if engagement is missing due other influences getting the upper hand in conquering the student’s attention, the process of second language acquisition will likely fail in the long term. Including these new concepts reviewed in this section (Ideal multilingual self, group dynamics, temporal dimension of motivation) to the current theories of motivation in second language learning acquisition can help to understand this concept more completely and can help teachers to maximise the students’ second language proficiency. 3.6 The Ideal multilingual self The Ideal multilingual self is an additional self guide that can develop from different Ideal L2 self guides on different second languages (Henry & Thorsen, 2017). When there are different Ideal L2 self guides on different languages (also denoted in literature by Ideal Lx and Ideal Ly), there could be interactions triggered by cross linguistic influences and if the interactions are complementary the Ideal multilingual self guide can develop. The Ideal multilingual self guide works together with the Ideal Lx and Ly self guides to generate motivation and creates “system-level cohesion and stability” (Henry & Thorsen, 2017, p. 352). In other words, students desire to learn Lx and Ly (driven by the Ideal Lx and Ly self guides) and they also desire to become plurilingual (because of the Ideal multilingual self guide). Henry and Thorsen (2017) theorise that in some cases the Ideal multilingual self guide could be a stronger self guide than the Ideal L2 self on a specific second language, which could actually be rather weak, if students are motivated by the desire to become plurilingual rather than to acquire the skills to speak in a specific second language. The relation between the Ideal multilingual self and the intended effort students put in studying a second language (which is a measure of motivation) and the relation between the Ideal multilingual self and the Ideal L2 self guide was researched empirically by Henry and Thorsen (2017) among secondary students in two Swedish schools with international profile. The sample used was rather large (N = 323) and quantitative methods were used to study the correlations among variables and build a structural equation model. The authors concluded that the Ideal multilingual and the Ideal L2 self are two different constructs though some overlap was present in the data. Moreover, the Ideal multilingual self is not directly related to the intended effort but only indirectly, and the relationship between the Ideal multilingual self and the intended effort was mediated by the Ideal L2 self guide, which was directly related to the intended effort (L2 in this study was either German, Spanish or French). Different explanations have been given on why the Ideal multilingual self was not directly associated with the intended effort. In summary, the different hypothesis presented pointed to the fact that the Ideal multilingual self is a higher level function tapping into a “broader and more diffuse dimension of a nascent identity” (Henry & Thorsen, 2017, p. 358), it requires a higher level of abstraction as it is less mentally connected to learning a specific language at school, and it might have not been fully developed yet in the target group subject of the study. This suggests that it might be harder for the Ideal multilingual self to emerge from empirical studies given the higher level of abstraction of this self guide and the fact that it may take longer to develop in students, as it may only have a direct relation to the intended effort once the nascent multilingual identity is fully formed. 3.7 Summary In this chapter an overview of theories of second language learning motivation has been presented. The first theory that dominated this field is Gardner’s socio education model of second language learning, according to which the concept of integrativeness, which is an individual’s openness to take on features of another cultural or linguistic group, plays a very important role in second language learning motivation, and students who have very high integrative motives typically manage to have better language achievements compared with students who are not as highly integratively motivated. On the other hand, instrumental motives are related to language achievement to a lower extent compared with integrative motives. Other theories were later developed and used concepts from mainstream psychology. Deci and Ryan’s self determination theory was applied by Noels on second language learning motivation. Noels distinguishes two main types of motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic motivation is a more self determined type of motivation than the extrinsic one and is associated to a higher degree to self perceived competence and intention to continue to learn the language. Dornyei established the L2 self motivation system which introduces the concepts of Ideal L2 self and Ought-to L2 self, by applying the concepts of ideal and ought self guides, previously described by Higgins in his self discrepancy theory, to L2 learning motivation. By doing so, Dornyei argues that the Ideal L2 self guide has a similar role as integrativeness in Gardner’s socio educational model and that in fact integrativeness should be replaced by the broader concept of Ideal L2 self which would be relevant also in case of foreign language learning motivation (i.e. in case the second language is not sufficiently present or available to the group of language learners in question). Dornyei also introduced the concept ‘L2 Learning Experience’, which covers all the various circumstances and situations that happen in the classroom and that influence motivation, and is also very relevant in predicting motivation. Later research by Henry and Thorsen has also examined a new self guide, the Ideal multilingual self, that can develop if there are more Ideal L2 self guides on different languages and if there are complementary interactions between the different Ideal L2 self guides, fuelled by cross linguistic influences. Similarities can be found among the concepts introduced in the different theories, specifically among the concepts of instrumentality, extrinsic motivation and Ought to L2 self on one hand and integrativeness, intrinsic motivation and Ideal L2 self on the other hand. Moreover, all theories deal with the study of motivation of specific target groups at a certain point in time and have been tested in many research studies, in different contexts and parts of the world. These studies though are cross sectional rather than longitudinal and do not tackle the aspect of temporal evolution of motivation. More recently, Dornyei and Ryan have tried to address the temporal nature of motivation recurring to instruments from psychological theories, namely the Big Five model from McAdams and Pals which includes personality traits that are contextualised in time and that could be useful in the study of second language acquisition.";

    speech.text = "4. Research Question and Methodology IV. Research Question and Methodology 4.1 Research question Considering that Dornyei's theory unites and adds to previous theories in the field of motivation studies, I have chosen to implement this theory to explore the motivation of a group of forty L2 learners and identify the most important factors associated with motivation. The question central to my research is: “What are the L2 motivational characteristics of international expatriates in Brussels who study English as a second language? “ In this research project, I have employed Taguchi's questionnaire (presented in section 3.4) to understand the English language learning motivation drivers of this specific students group of expatriates in Brussels. The project describes and analyses a small-scale survey aiming to define the L2 motivational characteristics of international expatriates in Brussels currently studying English, in order to find out if they are similar to the motivational patterns described in other studies. This questionnaire has been tested extensively and used in large-scale studies (Taguchi et al., 2009; You & Dörnyei, 2016), as well as small-scale studies (Markova & Yaneva, 2020). Therefore, this questionnaire can be a powerful tool also for the present research project to better understand the motivation drivers of specific smaller groups of learners within a context that has not been addressed yet by previous research (expatriates in Brussels learning English) and give teachers valuable insights on how to manage the students' learning experience in the most effective way. Many of the studies mentioned in the literature review show that the Ideal L2 self has a central role on L2 learning motivation (Csizer & Dornyei, 2005; Csizer & Kormos, 2009; Taguchi et al., 2009; Lamb, 2012; Teimouri, 2016) whereas the Ought-to L2 self is less related to L2 learning motivation, as either it could not be measured properly (Lamb, 2012), or it more weakly correlated with the intended effort (Csizer & Kormos, 2009; Taguchi et al., 2009; Teimouri, 2016). In the case of the present research study, it would not be fair to expect a similar outcome as the profile of the researched group (expatriates in Brussels) is very different from the one in the studies just mentioned (pupils attending primary or secondary school, or university students in their country of origin). In fact, in the case of expatriates, one could expect the presence of more instrumental motives linked to language learning motivation. For instance, Zhang and Harzing (2016) mention in their research about expatriates in China that “Most expatriates in our study wanted to learn the host country language because they believed that competence in the local language would benefit their current work in China and future career in general” (p.778). Moreover, the age of the group of expats subject of the present research is in the range of 20 – 58 years old which is older compared with the age range of the target group mentioned in most of the aforementioned studies (13-14 y.o. in Csizer & Dornyei, 2005; 16.5-21.5 y.o. on average in Csizer & Kormos, 2009; 13-14 y.o. in Lamb, 2012; 12-18 y.o. in Teimouri, 2016). Age may also affect motivational behaviour in the sense that instrumental motives (more linked with the Ought-to L2 self dimension) may be more present in older rather than younger individuals. Lamb (2012) could not obtain a reliable measure of the Ought-to L2 self and the author suggests this may be because “secondary school participants are still relatively young to internalize the pressure the environment might put on them” (Csizer & Lukacs, 2010, p.6 as cited in Lamb, 2012, p. 1006). Furthermore, Csizer & Kormos (2009) found a non significant correlation between the Ought-to L2 self and the motivated behaviour among secondary school students in Hungary 16.5 years old on average, though the correlation between the Ought-to L2 self and the motivated behaviour was significant (though still weak and much lower compared with the one between the Ideal L2 self and the motivated behaviour) among university students 21.5 years old on average. Therefore, it would not be surprising to find positive correlations between the Ought-to L2 self, or areas related to it, and the motivated behaviour, as outcome of the present research study. Given the profile of the respondents it may have been interesting to include questions related to the Ideal multilingual self to try to study this self guide too. However, as mentioned previously, the Ideal multilingual self could be hard to detect as it could be easily confounded with the Ideal L2 self. Henry and Thorsen (2017) did manage to separate the two constructs, however their study was on a much larger sample size (N = 323) compared with the study of the present research (N = 40). Furthermore, given the lack of previous literature on expatriates’ motivation to learn English and the small scale nature of this study, it would be preferrable to use a tool that has been already tested multiple times, like Taguchi’s questionnaire, both in large and small scale studies. The questionnaire Henry and Thorsen’s (2017) employed to measure the Ideal multilingual self is relatively new compared to Taguchi’s questionnaire, in fact, as the authors explain, piloting had to take place before defining the items related to the Ideal multilingual self: “Although the items for the criterion variable and for the ideal L2 self have previously been used in a Swedish context, the items designed to measure the ideal multilingual self have not. For this reason, piloting took place“ (Henry & Thorsen, 2017, p. 355). 4.2 Methodology 4.2.1 Participants The survey participants were 40 foreign expatriates in Brussels (Belgium), in the age range 20 – 58 years. 90% of the participants though were in the age range of 20 – 40, the remaining 10% being over 40 years old. The participants’ countries of origin are reported in the figure below. There are in total 17 countries of origin, across 3 different continents though most of them are in Europe (10 in Europe, 5 in Asia and 2 in Latin America). Figure 6: Respondents‘ countries of origin 27.5% of the respondents were male and 72.5% female. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. The data collection took place between June and July 2021. The questionnaire was shared via a Google Forms link to the students that had enrolled for an intermediate English course in the Saint Josse Language Centre (Brussels). 4.2.2 Instrument The Iranian version of the questionnaire used in Taguchi et al.’s (2009) study was used, as considered the most appropriate for this research context, including the same adaptations mentioned by Markova & Yaneva (2020) as also in the case of the foreign expatriates to Belgium the questions addressing beliefs related to Islam and Islamic culture are a sensitive issue in Belgian society at present. These adaptations consist in the omission of items 31, 46 and 52, present in the original questionnaire, addressing beliefs related to Islam and Islamic culture. Hence, the questionnaire consisted of 73 six-level Likert items which range from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (6) for the statements in Part I, and from not at all (1) to very much (6) for the questions in Part II. Multiple items were used to target the same motivation variable. In total the 73 items target 14 motivation variables which are listed below.";

    speech.text = "V. Results and discussion 5.1 Reliability analysis Reliability analysis was conducted on all variables to measure the consistency of the scales through Cronbach‘s alpha. Cronbach’s alpha was calculated in Excel using the definition formula: Where k is the number of question items used to describe the variable (for example 6 for the criterion measure, 8 for instrumentality prevention, 3 for travel orientation, etc.), var aggregate is the variance of the sum of the scores of all questions describing the variable and var question i is the variance of the score of each question describing the variable (indicated with the index i which also appears as summation index). The table below reports the values of the Cronbach’s alphas for the different variables. Variable Cronbach’s alpha Criterion measure (intended effort) 0.82 Ideal L2 self 0.67 Ought-to L2 self 0.82 Parental encouragement/family influence 0.83 Instrumentality - promotion 0.61 Instrumentality - prevention 0.84 Attitudes towards learning English 0.79 Travel orientation 0.69 Fear of assimilation 0.65 Ethnocentrism 0.69 English anxiety 0.88 Integrativeness 0.49 Cultural interest 0.76 Attitude towards L2 community 0.55 Table 4. Cronbach’s alpha for the different variables in the study All of the variables, excluding integrativeness and attitudes towards L2 community, have a Cronbach’s alpha above 0.6 which shows sufficient internal consistency of the subscales for these variables. On the other hand, integrativeness and attitudes towards the L2 community show a Cronbach’s alpha below 0.6, which shows an insufficient consistency of the subscales. The threshold of 0.6 is the one commonly adopted in literature as a minimum threshold to determine whether the scales are acceptably reliable (Lamb, 2012). To solve the issue of the low consistency of integrativeness and attitudes towards the L2 community, it was investigated whether removing one or more question items from these variables could help in increasing the Cronbach’s alpha above 0.6. For integrativeness, by removing question item 70 (“How much do you like English?“) the Cronbach’s alpha increased from 0.48 to 0.55, which is still below the threshold of 0.6. Trying to remove any other question instead would reduce the Cronbach’s alpha even further. The same conclusion is valid for Attitudes towards L2 community. For this variable, by removing question item 63 (“Do you like to travel to English-speaking countries?“) the Cronbach’s alpha increased from 0.55 to 0.57, which is still below 0.6. As it was not possible to optimise the subscale items to reach a satisfactory scale consistency, the variables integrativeness and attitudes towards L2 community have been excluded from the subsequent analysis. This result suggests that the student subject group of this study may seem to not clearly identify an L2 English speaking community, and the willingness or desire to take on characteristics and behaviours of the L2 community (integrativeness) and the attitudes towards the L2 community do not seem to make much sense in this case. This could be due to the highly globalised context in which this specific student group lives, Brussels, a very cosmopolitan city, where global English is spoken by people from different nationalities and with different cultural backgrounds. This hypothesis has been formulated before. For instance, as Lamb (2012) puts it, for many learners around the world it [L2] is no longer associated with any particular ethnic or national group but may instead be identified with either more educated and cosmopolitan members of one’s own group, or with an amorphous imagined community of international English users. (Lamb, 2012, p.1000). It is important to note that while integrativeness does not show a good enough reliability, the Ideal L2 self does. This result confirms Dornyei’s position according to which the Ideal L2 self is more suitable than integrativeness to predict motivated behaviour. 5.2 Mean scores analysis The table below presents the mean value of the motivation variables of the surveyed group and of the female and male subgroups. Variable Total Female Male Criterion measure (intended effort) 4.2 4.3 3.7 Ideal L2 self 5.5 5.7 4.9 Ought-to L2 self 2.8 2.7 3.1 Parental encouragement/family influence 2.8 2.9 2.7 Instrumentality - promotion 5.0 5.1 5.0 Instrumentality - prevention 3.5 3.4 3.6 Attitudes towards learning English 4.2 4.3 3.8 Travel orientation 5.2 5.2 5.3 Fear of assimilation 2.4 2.3 2.7 Ethnocentrism 2.2 2.2 2.2 English anxiety 2.2 2.2 2.2 Cultural interest 5.3 5.3 5.4 Table 5: Mean scores for each variable, including gender breakdown The highest average scores (5 or above) were attained for the variables Ideal L2 self, Instrumentality Promotion, Travel Orientation, and Cultural Interest. These are all variables expected to be linked to the Ideal L2 self domain. This is in line with the participants’ profile: as foreign expat students a positive attitude towards travel, intercultural experiences and in general different communities from the ones of their own country of origin is critical to ensure a successful academic and future work career. The lowest average scores (2.2) were attained for the variables Ethnocentrism and English anxiety. This is also expected based on the participants’ profile. Students who are willing to travel abroad and learn a new language must definitely overcome the anxiety to speak English with others and the fear of making mistakes for a successful integration in the foreign country and would not be willing to travel abroad in the first place if they were convinced that their country of origin is the best place to be. This result is in line with other studies where the same two motivation variables scored the lowest averages (Markova & Yaneva, 2020). In particular in this work from Markova & Yaneva (2020) the target group subject of the study are students in International Relations who are likely to have a positive and open attitude towards different cultures, given the choice of their degree. Therefore, it is understandable they would also have low scores on Ethnocentrism and English Anxiety like the expatriates in Brussels. The motivation variables Ought-to L2 self, Parental Encouragement and Fear of Assimilation scored the lowest averages if one excludes Ethnocentrism and English anxiety. This is again in line with other English language learning motivation studies (You and Dornyei, 2016; Markova & Yaneva, 2020) where the variables linked to the ought-to L2 self area scored the lowest average results. Especially when it comes to Fear of Assimilation, it is understandable that both profiles of expats in Brussels and students who have chosen to pursue a career in International Relations (target group in Markova & Yaneva ’s study) give similar low scores, as for both profiles intercultural communication and assimilation to other cultural groups are important parts of life and/or career. The average scores were pretty consistent between the genders, however for the Intended effort, Ideal L2 self and Attitudes towards Learning English the average scores of the female group are more than 0.5 points higher than the ones of the male group, showing that these areas seem to be more developed in women rather than men. 5.3 Correlation analysis The correlation matrix below shows in one overview the correlation factors between pairs of motivation variables. Table 6: correlation matrix between all variables Correlations between motivation variables and Intended Effort The motivation-effort correlation factors can be read in the first column, which contains all correlation factors between the different motivation variables and the Criterion measure (intended effort). The intended effort (just the mention ‘effort‘ is used in the table to save space) shows a statistically significant correlation at 99% confidence with the variables: Attitudes towards learning English (r = 0.73), Instrumentality Promotion (r = 0.44), Travel Orientation (r = 0.43) and a statistically significant correlation at 95% confidence with the variables: Instrumentality Prevention (r = 0.39), English Anxiety (r = 0.37), and Parental Encouragement (r = 0.35). The correlation with Attitudes towards learning English is strong, as it has a correlation coefficient r above 0.7, whereas the correlation with the other variables is moderate as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009). It seems that the encouragement these foreign expat students find in learning English is related to their positive attitude towards learning English and their enjoyment of the learning experience. This may be because in the context of the foreign expat students in Belgium, the English lessons are not only needed to improve the English language skills, but are also perceived as an opportunity for social interaction, cultural exchange and network building, much needed and uplifting for students who have left their home country and might feel lonely and disoriented in a foreign country. This observation is in line with previous publications: as Marta Zielinska (2017) suggests in her article about how to handle loneliness in expatriates, language exchange activities are a great way to meet new people. Also in Tom Czaban‘s (2020) interview of an “expat expert“ the interviewee suggests language exchange activities as a way to make friends when being abroad. Nevertheless, the strong correlation between the Intended Effort and Attitudes Towards Learning English is not surprising as it is a common result also from previous studies (Lamb, 2012; You and Dorney, 2016; Markova & Yaneva, 2020). Furthermore, in these studies the variable Attitudes Towards Learning English has the highest correlation factor with the Intended Effort, which is in tune with this aspect of the present study findings. Other important factors correlating with the intended effort are related to the instrumentality (both in a promotional or preventive aspect) and travel orientation. This is expected given the participants’ profiles. Foreign expat students of English see the importance of mastering the language to make future career opportunities possible for them and expand their travel opportunities. In her article, Yasim Pereira (n.d.) includes travelling and working/studying abroad among the five top reasons that propel expats to learn a new language. These are all motivational factors that are meaningful for this students category. This is consistent with previous research: for instance, international experience, job condition and labour market situation were three of the main factors motivating the expatriates interviewed in Froese’s (2012) study to move to Korea. Most of these variables relate to the Ought-to L2 self domain. In particular the motivation variables: Travel Orientation, Instrumentality-promotion, Instrumentality-prevention and Parental Encouragement are also strongly correlated to the Ought-to L2 self (correlations between Ought-to L2 self and other motivation variables will be discussed in more details later). Moreover, English Anxiety, though not directly correlated with the Ought-to L2 self, shows a significant correlation with the Instrumentality-prevention, which is correlated both with the Ought-to L2 self and the Intended Effort. The motivational impact of anxiety in a prevention focused learners has been theorised before. According to Teimouri (2016), “anxiety fits prevention-focused learners in stimulating them to expand more vigilant efforts to avoid the presence of negative outcomes. Thus, it is beneficial for their motivation.“ (p. 689). Given this, it seems that for this English language students sample, the Ought-to L2 self might play a bigger role than the Ideal L2 self in the way it is connected to the learning intended effort, though there seems to be no strong direct correlation between either the Ought-to L2 self or the Ideal L2 self variable to the Intended Effort variable. This is not in line with previous studies (Taguchi et al., 2009; Dorney and Chan, 2013; Markova & Yaneva, 2020) which show that the Ideal L2 self and the variables related to it are more closely connected to the language learning intended effort than the Ought-to L2 self. This might be due to the specific target group subject of this study which is different from the previous studies quoted. In particular, the Ideal L2 self might not be a strong enough self guide in this case to trigger motivation, in the sense of the process of reducing the discrepancy between the current self and the self guide. As mentioned in the theoretical overview section, it could be that in case of highly globalised contexts there is not enough discrepancy between the current perceived self and the ideal L2 English specific self guide, therefore the Ideal L2 self guide might not be able to explain motivated behaviour in these contexts (Henry and Cliffordson, 2017), and the concept of ‘Ideal multilingual self‘ might be more appropriate to explain motivated behaviour. It could be interesting to repeat a similar study in the future, using a larger sample, including a measure of the Ideal multilingual self construct to verify whether it could indeed significantly correlate with the Intended Effort. This study also confirms the result found in previous research that the Ought-to L2 self cannot explain the criterion measure. For instance, Taguchi at al. (2009) could not find a significant correlation between the Ought-to L2 self in their study on Japanese, Chinese and Iranian students and Martin Lamb (2012) could not even properly measure the Ought-to L2 self due to the lack of reliability of the scale. In the present study, the reliability of the Ought-to L2 self scale is good, as the Cronbach’s alpha is rather high (0.82), however the Ought-to L2 self does not correlate directly with the Intended Effort. Though the Ought-to L2 self does not correlate with the Intended Effort, four of the five variables correlating with the Intended Effort are also correlated with the Ought-to L2 self (Parental Encouragement, Instrumentality promotion, Instrumentality prevention and Travel Orientation). This suggests that the Ought-to L2 self might actually be an important motivating self guide for this specific students group. However, its correlation with the criterion measure does not come out directly from the analysis, potentially due to issues with the measurement of this variable. Correlations between Ideal L2 self and other motivation variables The Ideal L2 self variable showed statistically significant correlation at 95% confidence only with Instrumentality-promotion (r = 0.38). This is a moderate correlation, as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009). This is in line with the theory and previous studies showing that the Ideal L2 self has typically a strong correlation with Instrumentality-promotion (Higgins, 1998; Dornyei, 2009; Taguchi et al., 2009; Markova & Yaneva, 2020), though the actual value of the correlation factors from this study is lower than the correlation factors found in previous studies (r > 0.5). The correlation result from this study reinforces the point that the promotion focus is an important pillar of the ideal self guide, and that the Ideal L2 self is professionally successful (on top of being personally agreeable). The lack of correlation between Ideal L2 self and the instrumentality-prevention also confirms the promotion focus of the Ideal L2 self guide as opposed to the prevention focus of the Ought-to L2 self guide. The lack of correlation between the Ideal L2 self and family influence (which is strongly correlated to the Ought-to L2 self instead) shows once again that the family influence is more linked to the Ought-to L2 rather than the Ideal L2 self construct, corroborating previous results leading to the same conclusion (Taguchi et al., 2009; Markova & Yaneva, 2020). Previous studies (Taguchi et al., 2009) have also found significant positive correlation between the Ideal L2 self and integrativeness (concluding that Ideal L2 self and integrativeness tap into the same construct, though Ideal L2 self has a higher correlation with the criterion measure than integrativeness does) and the Ideal L2 self and Attitudes towards the L2 community, which led to the authors‘ conclusion that the Ideal L2 self is personally agreeable. These correlations could not be seen in this study because of the lack of reliability of the integrativeness and Attitudes towards L2 community scales. Correlations between Ought-to L2 self and other motivation variables The Ought-to L2 self motivation variable showed statistically significant correlation at 99% confidence with Family Influence (r = 0.77), Instrumentality-prevention (r = 0.69), Fear of Assimilation (r = 0.52), Travel Orientation (r = 0.42) and Instrumentality-promotion (r = 0.40). The correlation with Family Influence is strong, as it has a correlation coefficient r above 0.7, whereas the correlation with the other variables is moderate as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009). The first two correlations with Family Influence and Instrumentality-prevention are not at all surprising. It has been shown previously that motives that typically have a prevention focus and are coming from the external environment, like pressure from parents, enter into the ought-to self guide. Similar results and conclusions have been reached by Higgins (1998), Dornyei (2009) and Markova and Yaneva (2020) for other subject groups. It is also worth to note the significant correlation, though with a lower correlation factor, between the Ought-to L2 self and the Instrumentality-promotion. This is again not new and is a result common to other research work (Taguchi et al, 2009; Markova & Yaneva, 2020). There might be different reasons that might explain this correlation. In particular, Taguchi et al. (2009) hypothesise that parents invest in their children and expect the same attitude in return (in the context of the Chinese and Iranian groups subject of their study) and this might explain the high correlation between these two variables. One other possible explanation is the one provided by Teimouri (2016) who points out potential limitations of the questionnaire to describe the ought-to L2 self, as some questions refer to the presence or absence of positive outcomes (like ‘Studying English is important to me in order to gain the approval of my peers/teachers/family/boss’) and other questions refer to the presence or absence of negative outcomes (like ‘If I fail to learn English, I will be letting other people down’). It is not unreasonable that also in the context of foreign expat students, as well as in the Chinese and Iranian contexts, parents may have invested more financially compared with parents of students who did not go abroad to study and therefore they might expect their children also to wisely invest their time in their language education. However, this is not supported by the data of this survey given the lack of correlation between Family Influence and Instrumentality-promotion. A third possible explanation of the presence of a statistically significant correlation between Ought-to L2 self and Instrumentality-promotion is that it is just quite hard to separate the promotion from the prevention aspect of the instrumentality from this data, and the aspect of instrumentality should rather be considered just as a whole and one single entity. This is supported by the statistically significant correlation at 99% confidence between the variables Instrumentality-promotion and Instrumentality-prevention (r = 0.52). Given this, it becomes statistically very hard to try to distinguish the separate effect that these two variables have on the other motivation variables (such as Ideal L2-self or Ought-to L2 self) or on the Intended Effort variable. Markova and Yaneva (2020) also found this correlation between these two variables (r = 0.54). Further research, potentially with a bigger sample size or using qualitative research instruments, may be needed to try to reduce this inter-correlation and understand the separate effects between the two variables. The correlation between the Ought-to L2 self and Travel Orientation was also found in previous studies. For instance, Markova & Yaneva (2020) also found a positive correlation (r = 0.47, which is very similar to the value of r = 0.42 found in this study) between these two variables. For the group subject of this study, this could be explained by the positive attitude of expats to travelling and the students’ need to master the English language to continue travelling to meet their personal and career needs. As these are more extrinsic instrumental motives for learning English rather than intrinsic, they closely relate to the Ought-to L2 self construct. The final correlation of the Ought-to L2 self with Fear of Assimilation is not unexpected. More extrinsic instrumental motives to learn English, pertaining to the Ought-to L2 self sphere, are more likely to be related to the fear of losing the values and traditions from one’s country of origin. Correlations between the parental encouragement/family influence and other motivational variables Parental encouragement/family influence showed statistically significant correlation at 99% confidence with Instrumentality Prevention (r = 0.69), Fear of Assimilation (r = 0.5), and statistically significant correlation at 95% confidence with Travel Orientation (r = 0.39) and English Anxiety (r = 0.33). All these correlations are moderate as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009). The other correlations between Parental Encouragement and Intended Effort and the Ought-to L2 self have already been analysed above. The correlation between Parental Encouragement and Instrumentality Prevention is not surprising as both variables refer to extrinsic types of motives, rather than intrinsic, that are linked to the Ought-to L2 self guide and have a prevention focus. This correlation was also found in other studies (Markova & Yaneva, 2020) and was used in building structural equation models for the L2 self motivation system in Japanese, Chinese and Iranian contexts (Taguchi et al., 2009). The correlation between Parental Encouragement and Fear of Assimilation was not found in previous studies, though it is not counterintuitive. Fear of assimilation is expected to be present only in students with very low integrative motives and more extrinsically motivated, whereas students who are willing to integrate with the L2 community or are more intrinsically motivated would score low in Fear of Assimilation. Following the same direction, one would expect that also Parental Encouragement relates more to the less self determined forms of motivation. For the surveyed group in question, one could assume that if the motivation to expatriate to a foreign country to study English is mainly driven by parental encouragement, the student may more likely experience fear to incorporate in the new foreign context, as the motivation to move abroad would be mainly extrinsic rather than intrinsic in this case, or because of the pressure that the student may feel due to the parents’ expectations. The correlation between Parental Encouragement and Travel Orientation is open to interpretations. It is quite understandable that English language students who are expatriates in Belgium have a positive predisposition to travel, and this correlation might suggest that this attitude is inherited by their parents or family. Also, both Parental Encouragement and Travel Orientation are linked to the dimensions of the Ought-to L2 self (they both have significant correlations with the Ought-to L2 self), therefore a positive correlation between these two variables is imaginable. The correlation between Parental encouragement and English Anxiety has also been found in previous studies (Markova & Yaneva, 2020). Anxiety might be triggered by the expectations of parents towards their children. Other authors also agree with this conclusion (Papi, 2010). Moreover, Teimouri (2016) introduces the concept of the Ought-to L2 self/others which describes attributes one is expected by others (including family) to have. This is the most extrinsic type of self guide and its discrepancy with the current perceived self can generate feelings of anxiety. Correlations between Instrumentality Promotion and other motivational variables Instrumentality Promotion showed a statistically significant correlation at 99% confidence with Travel orientation (r = 0.51) and a statistically significant correlation at 95% confidence with Attitudes towards learning English (r = 0.34). Both correlations are moderate as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009). The correlations between Instrumentality Promotion and the Intended Effort, the Ideal L2 self, the Ought-to L2 self and the Instrumentality Prevention have already been discussed above. The correlation between Instrumentality Promotion and Travel Orientation is expected, since the respondents are foreign expatriates English students to Belgium and they need to master the use of English well enough to make sure their experience in the foreign country brings good outcomes, and that they could continue to have successful experiences as expatriates also in other countries. As discussed previously, the two types of instrumentality (promotion and prevention) are highly correlated between each other. It is also found that Travel Orientation correlates not only with Instrumentality Promotion but also with Instrumentality Prevention. This seems to suggest that some students may perceive travelling abroad in a promotional way (e.g. they would need to master the language to have positive experiences abroad, both current and future) and some other students may perceive travelling abroad in a preventional way (e.g. they would like to work after their studies still in the current foreign country where they live or in another foreign country, and they would not be able to do it if they did not know how to communicate in English well enough). This line of thought is also suggested by Taguchi et al. (2009). Moreover, Dornyei and Kormos (2000) also found out as a result of their study, that travel incentives were involved in the instrumental motivational dimension and they introduced the label ‘incentive values’ to refer to this more complete concept. The correlation between Instrumentality Promotion and Attitudes towards learning English has been seen in previous studies (Markova & Yaneva, 2020). Students with an instrumental-promotional focus on English language acquisition appreciate the importance of learning English to achieve a valued goal, and this contributes to building a positive attitude towards the language learning, which ultimately determines the effort students intend to spend during the language acquisition process. Correlations between Instrumentality Prevention and other motivational variables Instrumentality Prevention showed a statistically significant correlation at 99% confidence with Fear of Assimilation (r = 0.44) and a statistically significant correlation at 95% confidence with English Anxiety (r = 0.35). Both correlations are moderate as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009). The correlations between Instrumentality Prevention and the Intended Effort, Ought-to L2 self, Parental Encouragement, Instrumentality Promotion and Travel Orientation have been already discussed above. The other two correlations of Instrumentality Prevention, i.e. with Fear of Assimilation and English Anxiety are not surprising as Fear of Assimilation and English Anxiety are expected to be present in students with less self determined types of motivation which typically have a prevention focus. Other correlations The other significant correlations present in the correlation matrix and not discussed so far are the positive correlation between Ethnocentrism and Fear of Assimilation (r = 0.46) and Ethnocentrism and English Anxiety (r = 0.33). Both correlations are moderate as the coefficient r is between 0.3 and 0.7 (Ratner, 2009). These correlations are understandable. Ethnocentric beliefs, which are mainly about pride and superiority of one’s country of origin, can give rise to feelings of anxiety when having to speak a different language from one’s own and feelings of fear of being part of a different cultural group.";

    speech.text = "6.Summary VI. Summary and conclusions 5.1 Summary of the findings The objective of this study is to find out the main motivation factors of English language learning for a specific target group, namely foreign expat students of English in an international city like Brussels. The sample size employed in this study was big enough to carry out statistical analysis, though the results and conclusions of this study should not be generalised and application in other contexts should be handled with caution. Taguchi’s (2009) questionnaire was used as instrument to identify the main motivational variables related to the intended effort. Taguchi’s (2009) questionnaire was formulated in the context of Dornyei’s theory of L2 self motivation system. In his theory, Dornyei built on Gardner’s socio-education model of second language learning and introduced the new concept of Ideal L2 self, replacing the concept of integrativeness in Gardner’s theory, to be able to address the situations where the second language and communities of L2 native speakers are not present or available to the L2 learners group in question (i.e. the case of foreign rather than second language learning), and therefore the concept of integrativeness may not be relevant. The Ought-to L2 self is the other self guide introduced by Dornyei who has leveraged the concepts of ideal and ought-to self guides in Higgin’s (1998) self discrepancy theory in mainstream psychology. Similarities can be found among the Ideal L2 and Ought-to L2 self guide in Dornyei’s theory, the concepts of integrativeness and instrumentality in Gardner’s socio educational model and the ideas of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation introduced by Noels (2003) reapplying Deci and Ryan’s (1985) self determination theory. The L2 learning experience is an additional variable introduced in Dornyei’s theory to tackle all circumstances and situations that happen in the classroom and that influence motivation. Some of the results from this study are in agreement with previous research studies having similar objectives but on different English students target groups and with the L2 Motivational Self System. For instance, participants have given higher scores on average on factors associated with the ideal L2 self compared with the ought-to L2 self. The data from this study supports the link between promotional aspects of motivation with the Ideal L2 self, whereas the factors pertaining to extrinsic motives are closer to the ought-to L2 self. Other results differ from previous studies. For instance, even though also here the impact of the ought-to L2 self on the learning intended effort is not evident, as the correlation between the Ought-to L2 self and Intended Effort variable is non-significant, most of the factors that strongly correlate with the Intended Effort are also strongly correlating with the Ought-to L2 self. This seems to suggest that the Ought-to L2 self might play a bigger role than the Ideal L2 self on the motivation to study English for this specific group of students. This is not consistent with previous studies (Taguchi et al., 2009; You and Dornyei, 2016) which showed a stronger correlation between the ideal L2 self and the motivated L2 learning behaviour. The absence of predictive power of the Ideal L2 self on the Intended Effort may be related to the highly globalised environment of the specific group subject of this research, and suggests that other concepts, like the Ideal multilingual self might be more suitable to predict the Intended Effort. Further research would be needed to verify whether this hypothesis is correct. Though Ideal L2 self was not predictive of the Intended Effort, the scale showed satisfactory reliability, unlike integrativeness and attitudes towards the L2 community which had to be excluded from the analysis, as their reliability was not high enough. This confirms that the Ideal L2 self is more valuable than integrativeness to explain the motivated behaviour. One other result which is not in line with the L2 Motivational Self System, however it was also found in previous research studies (Markova & Yaneva, 2020), is the inter-correlation between the promotional and preventive aspect of the instrumentality variable. This does not allow to statistically separate the impacts of these two different aspects of instrumentality on the other motivational variables and the criterion measure. This may be due to the fact that even questions phrased as promotional might have a preventive interpretation in the mind of the respondents. The two types of instrumentality were also both correlated at 99% confidence with the travel orientations. Thus, in this research both instrumentalities and travel orientations should be included in one common concept (called incentive values) which is a strong predictor of the intended effort, together with attitudes towards learning English (Dornyei and Kormos, 2000). More in depth research, perhaps using qualitative research instruments, may be needed to separate these three aspects. The figure below attempts to visualise how the different motivation variables impact the Intended Effort and how they are interacting between each other. The figure is built in the following way: it starts with the motivational variables which are correlated with the Intended Effort at 99% confidence (p < 0.01), these are: Attitudes towards learning English, Instrumentality promotion and Travel orientation. The arrows linking the Intended Effort with these three variables represent these correlations and the respective correlation coefficients (r) are reported. As a second step, the variables which are correlated at 95% confidence (p < 0.05) with the Intended Effort and correlated at 99% confidence with the above mentioned three variables are reported. In this case it is only the Instrumentality Prevention which is correlated at 95% confidence with the Intended Effort and at 99% confidence with both Instrumentality Promotion and Travel Orientation. The arrows linking Instrumentality Prevention with Instrumentality Promotion and Travel Orientation represent these correlations (at 99% confidence) and the respective correlation coefficients (r) are reported. As third and last step, the variables which are correlated at 95% confidence with the Intended Effort and at 99% confidence with Instrumentality Prevention (the last variable included in the figure) are added. There is only one variable which meets these criteria, and that is Parental Encouragement. Again, the correlation at 99% confidence between Parental Encouragement and Instrumentality Prevention is represented by the arrow and the corresponding correlation coefficient (r) is reported. There are no more variables correlated at 95% confidence with the Intended Effort and at 99% confidence with any of the variables already included in the figure. From the figure it is easier to visualise that Instrumentality Promotion, Travel Orientation and Instrumentality Prevention are correlated among each other at 99% confidence, and so they should be included in one common concept (incentive values represented by the green box). As mentioned previously, this is consistent with the approach followed by other authors (Dornyei and Kormos, 2000). Finally, the variables which are correlated with the Ideal L2 self are represented in italic font (only one, i.e. Instrumentality-promotion) and the variables which are correlated with the Ought-to L2 self are represented in underlined font (four variables, i.e.: Instrumentality-promotion, Instrumentality-prevention, Travel orientation and Parental encouragement). As there are more variables correlating with the Ought-to L2 self than the ones correlating with the Ideal L2 self, there is some indication that the Ought-to L2 self may be playing a more important role than the Ideal L2 self on motivated behaviour and intended effort, though neither the Ought-to L2 self nor the Ideal L2 self directly correlate with the intended effort as a result of this study. Figure 7: Visualisation of variables affecting intended effort and how they relate to each other. Italic font indicates the variable is also correlated with the Ideal L2 self. Underlined font indicates the variable is also correlated with the Ought to L2 self. 5.2 Pedagogic applications The results of this study could help English teachers dealing with foreign expat students to adapt their lessons and teaching approach in a way to maximise the students’ motivation. The strongest factor emerging from this study that relates to the effort students intend to invest in studying English is the Attitudes towards learning English. On that account, a good advice for teachers could be to make sure the whole English learning experience is pleasant and enjoyable, for instance by giving enough opportunities to the students to connect among each other during the lessons, thus helping them build a network away from home. The second strongest factor associated with the intended effort is represented by the Incentive Values. Therefore, one other recommendation for teachers who want to increase their students’ motivation could be to leverage the value students place in mastering English as a means to expand their work, study and travel possibilities further. Sharing success stories of expats who managed to grasp a good career opportunity thanks to their English language skills could be a way to achieve this outcome. Certainly, it is not always the case that each expat student’s motivation will increase on every occasion if and only if this advice is followed, however these recommendations represent a few insights on how the results of this study could be used in an actual teaching context to drive language learning motivation.";
